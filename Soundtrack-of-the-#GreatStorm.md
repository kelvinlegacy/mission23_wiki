# Prince
Prince Rogers Nelson is related to the Rogers family of Sandy Hook, TN making him Micah’s cousin. 

## Sign of the Times
* This song shared a narrative of the past several years (2018-2023) along with a look back to the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
* “By chance she came across a needle and soon she did the same” … The needle was clean, just removed from its packaging. Filled with new in factory seal pharmaceuticals. The pharmaceuticals were related to blood transfusions and organ transplants. This is a secret the pharmaceutical industry never wanted anyone to know. It was not gay men who started the crisis. The first HIV positive patients got it not from blood or organs, but the drugs. #PrayToVerify 
* The rest of the song is all true and happened. 
* Thanks to the Creator, Atlanta saw the dawn many times when they otherwise wouldn’t have. 

# Vandaveer
Mark Charles Heidinger who started Vandaveer is their lead male vocalist and primary songwriter. Mark was a longtime friend of Micah’s and a victim of the tragedy. 

When listening to Vandaveer, especially the two albums discussed herein, the listener should know that it is one of the following talking: the Creator, Micah[[1]], Thomas, Main or a special guest. 

## Divide & Conquer 
### Resurrection Mary
* Annie recounts the CIA’s need to gather information about the land owners in Sandy Hook. 
* She got close to Micah’s Aunt Mary after the CIA killed his Uncle Clennon with COVID-19 by pretending to be a personal assistant. 

### A Mighty Leviathan of Old
* The song begins with Kelvin talking to Main about their opposing views regarding the larger tragedy. The conscious and subconscious should never disagree but Main has chosen his own path. 
* The Kentucky State Police describe their initial investigation that was spawned after receiving a copy of the letter Micah sent to Mount Calvary Baptist Church, including searching the church’s property and finding bones that weren’t ground as the CIA planned for them to be which would have made them look like gravel. 
* Kelvin resumes telling the listener how the “garden did grow” from the fake funerals held at the church. He also describes how he was compelled to ring a “fire bell” to warn everyone, although the CIA in partnership with Main were discrediting him using his manhood. But the Creator rained down his will causing that bell to break. The CIA’s attempts to defame Kelvin failed and he still try to alert as many people as possible until it spread like wildfire. 
* Then Annie tells how God spoke to her for the first time in her life through Vandaveer’s music. 

## Before the Great War 
* The Great War is the #GreatStorm
* The Creator first describes Thomas. 
* Then continues to describe Annie of the CIA. 
* Then describes the US federal government.
* The song concludes with the Creator talking to Thomas. 

## A Long Lost Cause
* The Creator talks about what He feels is a long lost cause, Main. 
* Main, Kelvin’s subconscious is described as “he.”
* Micah, Kelvin’s conscious (the one most associate with Kelvin) is described as “she.” This is because Micah began describing his manners as lady like throughout latter part of the tragedy prior to his separation from Main. 

## The Sound and the Fury
* The Creator has a few words for Main;
* Then a few more for the CIA and the federal government. 

***
[[1]] On “Divide & Conquer” Micah is still Kelvin until the very end, when the Creator divides him and Main.
