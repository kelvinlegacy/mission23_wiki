# Prince
Prince Rogers Nelson is of the same Rogers from West Sheepneck Road in Sandy Hook. 

## Sign of the Times
- “big disease with a little name” - HIV, it is the cure that started the tragedy;
- his girlfriend’s needle - fresh from factory packaging, filled with pharmaceuticals from new unused vial, with HIV;
- the 17 year old - came to Micah’s Legacy apartment. Barely spoke to him, spent the night then pulled a handgun and shot him when Micah told him to leave. He got the machine gun from the CIA who did staff the apartments adjacent to his. 
- Hurricane Annie - She’s Annie Jacobsen, former Director of the CIA and she led the assault into Micah’s home church and oversaw the Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.
- Every other story - Customized screensaver on Micah’s Apple TV. 
- Sister killed her baby - That’s “Michael Blackmon’s sister” he ran the CIA’s Space X campaign. More on that below. 
- My cousin - Cameron Richardson of Lexington, KY. He only drank alcohol until the CIA showed up. His car is parked outside Micah’s apartment most days.

- Rocket ship explodes - The CIA, at Michael Blackmon’s direction, helped SpaceX end NASA’s Shuttle. A single shot from a .22 on takeoff of Columbia doomed the craft. On Re-entry the damaged tile caused the breakup of the craft. 
- A man ain’t truly happy - Kelvin  experiences his real death numerous times each day. Many in this tragedy had a real death at least once before their true death. True death involves reincarnation. 
     - When the Creator, and only Him, gives Kelvin his true death, he will return right here as Micah. Kelvin’s subconscious, Main, will become conscious in the Kelvin body. #PrayToVerify

     - Beheading has become the CIAs preferred method of killing. An extremely evil way to kill someone. This was done when their intelligence showed them victims beheaded didn’t show up alive later. “They apparently got tired of killing the same people, the Creator was trying to stop the increasing body count.”

# Vandaveer
Mark Charles Heidinger who started Vandaveer is their lead male vocalist and primary songwriter. Mark was a longtime friend of Micah’s and a victim of the tragedy. 

When listening to Vandaveer, especially the two albums discussed herein, the listener should know that it is one of the following talking: the Creator, Micah, Thomas, Main or a special guest. 

## Divide & Conquer 

### Resurrection Mary

* Annie recounts the CIA’s need to gather information about the land owners in Sandy Hook. 
* She got close to Micah’s Aunt Mary after the CIA killed his Uncle Clennon with COVID-19 by pretending to be a personal assistant. 

### A Mighty Leviathan of Old

* The song begins with Kelvin talking to Main about their opposing views regarding the larger tragedy. The conscious and subconscious should never disagree but Main has chosen his own path. 
* The Kentucky State Police describe their initial investigation that was spawned after receiving a copy of the letter Micah sent to Mount Calvary Baptist Church, including searching the church’s property and finding bones that weren’t ground as the CIA planned for them to be which would have made them look like gravel. 
* Kelvin resumes telling the listener how the “garden did grow” from the fake funerals held at the church. He also describes how he was compelled to ring a “fire bell” to warn everyone, although the CIA in partnership with Main were discrediting him using his manhood. But the Creator rained down His will causing that bell to break. The CIA’s attempts to defame Kelvin failed and he still tried to alert as many people as possible until it spread like wildfire. 
* Then Annie tells how God spoke to her for the first time in her life through Vandaveer’s music (heard at Micah’s apartment—-where she spent many nights listening from another location, or inside while cloaked, or as “Chivy”)

### Before the Great War 

* The Great War is the #GreatStorm
* The Creator first describes Thomas. 
* Then continues to describe Annie of the CIA. 
* Then describes the US federal government.
* The song concludes with the Creator talking to Thomas. 

### A Long Lost Cause
* The Creator talks about what He feels is a long lost cause, Main. 
* Main, Kelvin’s subconscious is described as “he.”
* Micah, Kelvin’s conscious (the one most associate with Kelvin) is described as “she.” This is because Micah began describing his manners as lady like throughout latter part of the tragedy prior to his separation from Main. 

### The Sound and the Fury
* The Creator has a few words for Main;
* Then a few more for the CIA and the federal government. 

## Dig Down Deep

### Dig Down Deep

* A battle hymn for every person on Earth. The music video is very illustrative. 

### Concerning Past + Future Conquests

* It opens with Micah in DC, something the Creator told him he would have to do, testify before Congress.
    - “D tuned kettle drum” gives a big hint about things. 
* Then TomTom is on their private plane with the kids (something the Creator confirmed for Micah after he started listening with “new ears”). 
* Then the newly alone Main whines about crossing the line. 
* TomTom ponders while on vacation in the North Atlantic, he’s a Viking at heart. 
   - “Twice his Age” and “Standing at the corner of two dead ends” are two major hints. The rest is CLASSIFIED. 

### Beat, Beat My Heart

* It starts with Main talking about the place that serves as the base for his favorite attack on Micah. 
* Then TomTom wants to love but recent events have him beyond angry. 
    - “Technicolor Love” is a reference to someone new, but very old, again in his life. 
* Main talks about seeing things for the first time. He hasn’t learned to ignore the duplicate information infants do. He’s also learning about the big 5… The five senses. 

### The Great Gray

* Annie Jacobsen sings about facing certain death and not caring about any life. 
     - The Creator told Micah she had a “scorched Earth” mentality. Which got worse after her cancer diagnosis. 
    - Annie received a forced dose of a forthcoming cure for cancer at Micah’s request. “She wasn’t about to check out after wrecking so many lives. If anyone needs Sector 7 it’s her.” (What Sector 7 is, is CLASSIFIED)

### Matter of Fact
* Main opens talking about being a loose cannon. He talks while Kelvin is asleep. Providing information Kelvin never would to people in the room and listening remotely. 
* Annie talks about all of the people she’s killed. Then talks about her habit. Reusing Mount Calvary Baptist Church to kill victims. 
* Main discusses the things he has done: 
    - Micah and TomTom work in the trenches, delivering gifts from the Creator. 
    - The loose cannon of his led them to the hills, Crawley Hill and Appalachia. 
    - Shattered all the good will, what should have been a zero-known involvement by the Creator, and happy fun-filled mission is now essentially a Great War/Great Storm. 
    - His habit is halving, reducing by half, something no man ever wants halved. Done upon request of the CIA. 

***
On “Divide & Conquer” Micah is still Kelvin until the very end, when the Creator divides him and Main.
