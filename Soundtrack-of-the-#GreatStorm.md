# Prince
Prince Rogers Nelson is of the same Rogers from West Sheepneck Road in Sandy Hook. 

## Alphabet Street
- Micah says, “For maximum effect, listen to [this version](https://music.apple.com/us/album/alphabet-st/1544343951?i=1544343953) on “The Hits & The B-Sides.”
- Alphabet Street is a graveyard. Think tombstones and grave markers. 
- The first girl that I meet is just a guy he knows very well, who won’t recognize him. 
- Micah better talk fast. Really fast. To get him to want him from his head to his feet. 
- Micah hates Fords. Don’t think “dad” think Father. And, think Phoenix. 
- Tennessee. Where Micah and his family always go. There’s only one destination for them. 
- Watch. That girl mentioned earlier is more of a target than Micah, she won’t be in the mood. She wants to watch Micah do a grave audit. 
- Kat. Would be Katrina. Although not rapping, the conversation happened practically verbatim in Katrina’s kitchen while she was cooking with Main, in front of the CIA’s cloaked personnel, Baby is another name Main goes by. Main decided it belong to him… 
- Run tell your mamma. That would be Annie Jacobsen, not Patricia Williams. Main considers that his family. 
- Going down, down, down… There are no bodies there in a family graveyard used since around 1888 when Sandy Hook first appeared on maps. 
- “Get off Alphabet Street” is something Micah expects to hear. 
- Micah says, “One must listen to the recital of the alphabet at the end of the song.”
- Micah recalls one grave marker with such bad English in an inscription that the company didn’t want to waste the granite. So they confirmed it by multiple employees. The customer, a family member, kept saying it’s right. Micah says “it’s so bad, it stops most people in their tracks. You have to put yourself back in Sandy Hook vernacular to see what it says.”
- The inscription begins “God” and says something about “ His love,” Micah is intentionally vague. Micah will in a commit extended description place what he’s looking for before he arrives on Alphabet Street (Sheepneck Cemetery/Orr Chapel Cemetery) and after the first quake. 
- The company, still in business, still has what has to be the most signed off order for the grave marker ever. It only exists on paper. 
- Did you notice the missing “G”? Did you hear what is said after the letter “I.”
- Micah knows the work order will be enough to justify his presence up on Alphabet Street. That and a family member is always present at an exhumation, which Micah must do to prove his DNA and ownership of the land. 
- The graveyard, according to the Creator, graveyard was dug up and headstones pulverized when Orr Chapel was destroyed. 

## Sign of the Times
- “big disease with a little name” - HIV, it is the cure that started the tragedy;
- his girlfriend’s needle - fresh from factory packaging, filled with pharmaceuticals from new unused vial, with HIV;
- the 17 year old - came to Micah’s Legacy apartment. Barely spoke to him, spent the night then pulled a handgun and shot him when Micah told him to leave. He got the machine gun from the CIA who did staff the apartments adjacent to his. 
- Hurricane Annie - She’s Annie Jacobsen, former Director of the CIA and she led the assault into Micah’s home church and oversaw the Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.
- Every other story - Customized screensaver on Micah’s Apple TV. 
- Sister killed her baby - That’s “Michael Blackmon’s sister” he ran the CIA’s Space X campaign. More on that below. 
- My cousin - Cameron Richardson of Lexington, KY. He only drank alcohol until the CIA showed up. His car is parked outside Micah’s apartment most days.

- Rocket ship explodes - The CIA, at Michael Blackmon’s direction, helped SpaceX end NASA’s Shuttle. A single shot from a .22 on takeoff of Columbia doomed the craft. On Re-entry the damaged tile caused the breakup of the craft. 
- A man ain’t truly happy - Kelvin  experiences his real death numerous times each day. Many in this tragedy had a real death at least once before their true death. True death involves reincarnation. 
     - When the Creator, and only Him, gives Kelvin his “true death,” he will return right here as Micah, in a body he has occupied before on Earth. Kelvin’s subconscious, Main, will become conscious in the Kelvin body. #PrayToVerify
     - Beheading has become the CIAs preferred method of killing. An extremely evil way to kill someone. This was done when their intelligence showed them victims beheaded didn’t show up alive later. “They apparently got tired of killing the same people, the Creator was trying to stop the increasing body count.”

# Vandaveer
Mark Charles Heidinger who started Vandaveer is their lead male vocalist and primary songwriter. Mark was a longtime friend of Micah’s and a victim of the tragedy. 

When listening to Vandaveer, especially the two albums discussed herein, the listener should know that it is one of the following talking: the Creator, Micah, Thomas, Main or a special guest. 

## Divide & Conquer 

### Resurrection Mary

* Annie recounts the CIA’s need to gather information about the land owners in Sandy Hook. 
* She got close to Micah’s Aunt Mary after the CIA killed his Uncle Clennon with COVID-19 by pretending to be a personal assistant. 

### A Mighty Leviathan of Old

* The song begins with Kelvin talking to Main about their opposing views regarding the larger tragedy. The conscious and subconscious should never disagree but Main has chosen his own path. 
     - Main is what the Creator called a “classic split” which **is not a psychiatric** condition. Classic splits occur when the subconscious starts to think for itself and determine they are better off without the conscious. Main wants Micah dead, since the Creator will not allow him to be killed, Main wants Micah to suffer. Mains want for Micah to suffer is so great, he will suffer himself just to see Micah suffer. 
     - As a classic split, Main could have helped the pair help every human on the planet. That was what was supposed to happen. But Main, a conscious entity himself, embraced all seven deadly sins and the CIA instead. 
* The Kentucky State Police in Frankfort describe their initial investigation that was spawned after receiving a call from Micah. They went to Lexington (foreign for them, the Richmond post covers Lexington) to canvass for answers, then to Mount Calvary Baptist Church. They discuss searching the church’s property and finding bones that weren’t ground as the CIA planned for them to be, which would have made the bones look like gravel. 
* Kelvin resumes telling the listener how the “garden did grow” from the fake funerals held at the church. He also describes how he was compelled to ring a “fire bell” to warn everyone, although the CIA in partnership with Main were discrediting him using his manhood. But the Creator rained down His will causing that bell to break. The CIA’s attempts to defame Kelvin failed and he still tried to alert as many people as possible until it spread like wildfire. 
* Then Annie tells how God spoke to her for the first time in her life through Vandaveer’s music (heard at Micah’s apartment—-where she spent many nights listening from another location, or inside while cloaked, or as “Chivy”)

### Before the Great War 

* The Great War is the #GreatStorm
* The Creator first describes Thomas. 
* Then continues to describe Annie of the CIA. 
* Then describes the US federal government.
* The song concludes with the Creator talking to Thomas. 

### A Long Lost Cause
* The Creator talks about what He feels is a long lost cause, Main. 
* Main, Kelvin’s subconscious is described as “he.”
* Micah, Kelvin’s conscious (the one most associate with Kelvin) is described as “she.” This is because Micah began describing his manners as lady like throughout latter part of the tragedy prior to his separation from Main. 
     - Micah has no desire to be female. 
     - With his boss, the Creator, identified he cannot be his normal self. Way more self control is required. Being a lady. 
     — Micah has had in his presence individuals who have killed his friends, family, church family and he thought, the love of his life. Micah’s first and natural instinct was to rip their heads off. But, he generally treated them with respect and bit his tongue. Like a true lady. 

### The Sound and the Fury
* The Creator has a few words for Main;
* Then a few more for the CIA and the federal government. 

## Dig Down Deep

### Dig Down Deep

* A battle hymn for every person on Earth. The music video is very illustrative. 

### Concerning Past + Future Conquests

* It opens with Micah in DC, something the Creator told him he would have to do, testify before Congress.
    - “D tuned kettle drum” gives a big hint about things. Watch the drum (what’s printed on it) in “Beat, beat my heart.”
* Then TomTom is on their private plane with the kids (something the Creator confirmed for Micah after he started listening with “new ears”). 
* Then the newly alone Main whines about crossing the line. 
* TomTom ponders while on vacation in the North Atlantic, he’s a Viking at heart. 
   - “Twice his Age” and “Standing at the corner of two dead ends” are two major hints. The rest is CLASSIFIED. 

### Beat, Beat My Heart

* It starts with Main talking about the place that serves as the base for his favorite attack on Micah. 
* Then TomTom wants to love but recent events have him beyond angry. 
    - “Technicolor Love” is a reference to someone new, but very old, again in his life. Micah. 
* Main talks about seeing things for the first time. He hasn’t learned to ignore the duplicate information infants do. He’s also learning about the big 5… The five senses. 

### The Great Gray

* Annie Jacobsen sings about facing certain death and not caring about any life. 
     - The Creator told Micah she had a “scorched Earth” mentality. Which got worse after her cancer diagnosis. 
    - Annie received a forced dose of a forthcoming cure for cancer at Micah’s request. “She wasn’t about to check out after wrecking so many lives. If anyone needs Sector 7 it’s her.” (What Sector 7 is, is CLASSIFIED)

### Matter of Fact
* Main opens talking about being a loose cannon. He talks while Kelvin is asleep. Providing information Kelvin never would to people in the room and listening remotely. 
* Annie talks about all of the people she’s killed. Then talks about her habit. Reusing Mount Calvary Baptist Church to kill victims. 
* Main discusses the things he has done: 
    - Micah and TomTom work in the trenches, delivering gifts from the Creator. 
    - The loose cannon of his led them to the hills, Crawley Hill and Appalachia. 
    - Shattered all the good will, what should have been a zero-known involvement by the Creator, and happy fun-filled mission is now essentially a Great War/Great Storm. 
    - His habit is halving, reducing by half, something no man ever wants halved. Done upon request of the CIA. 

### Nature of our Kind
* This song leads us up to the [“shaking under our feet”](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell) or [“the ringing of the bell”](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell).
* Micah says, “It is practically a checklist and covers the past several months of his life.”
     - Talks about a CIA agent and part time friend of his Martin. 
     - An attempt on his life with Martin and Foot. 
     - His trip to his old home in Tahoma Drive
     - Being shot and arrested in a setup. 
     - Being locked away and further secured while they attacked Mount Calvary Baptist Church. 
     - (Current as of Sunday September 3, 2023)
     - Main then tells about walking around for days and days, because he’s pissed off the Creator. 
     - 1,000 points of light cut through the “Great Storm in the Sky.” 

***
On “Divide & Conquer” Micah is still Kelvin until the very end, when the Creator divides him and Main.
