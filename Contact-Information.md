At the present time, the Creator only allows the use of Wire for any secure communication.

If you demand WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal, the SotC will recommend they talk to you using plain old telephone service, or your native SMS apps.  Because, the NSA is going to read it anyway.  (Insert joke about saving CPU cycles/energy here...  Nevermind, no savings potential.)

# Contact
To contact Micah see his [Wire profile](https://account.wire.com/user-profile/?id=1CFBE1AC-E293-40D5-A38F-1E165D3DE50D).

# Social Media
We really like GitHub since Facebook and Twitter are obviously not about free speech, big supporters of hiding the truth and... We like Git commit messages now (thanks to someone's prayers that Micah start using git better, more NSA proof, and using GitHub in a more NSL proof way).

## Old Social Media Accounts
### Micah
If someone is using them, its likely not Micah (remember, he was born Kelvin Eugene Williams, and well there's the whole Divide & Conquer situation which resulted in Micah and Main--Main remains in the Kelvin body).

Facebook: @kelvinewilliams; Twitter: @kelvinewilliams, @kelvinatlanta.   

### TomTom
Just find him at Hardee's.  He'll be the one whining about not having a flip phone available to him at the store.

### Servants of the Creator
We did have @ASOTC23.  Got locked out by their design.
