The Creator does not ever intervene in human events. Ever. Once humans decide to do something, they will do it. When blocked or prevented by an unseen force, human nature is to escalate their actions.

We see escalations all the time: When you’re hammering a nail and it doesn’t go in, you swing the hammer harder, change your grip, and sometimes end up an injuring yourself.

Another reason He doesn’t is… Where would it stop? He help one situation, He must help them all. When we have perfection everywhere, there’s no reason to live. Utopias sound great on paper, but in practice they bring an end to the Creator’s vision, which is life. All conscious entities actually need something to fix or improve, so that we want to continue living and creating future generations.

From time to time the Creator will “rain” things down. Force things to go the way they need to. For example, nuclear war in the 60s—that wasn’t rain, but a light drizzle. The right people got into the positions needed and “cooler heads” prevailed. Without that drizzle, Earth would be a different place today, probably devoid of life.

The #GreatStorm is not drizzle or rain, nor the flood in Noah’s Ark.

To understand the Biblical flood, one must understand arks are not boats, they are messages or a lesson (think: the Ark of the Covenant, no boat). The takeaway from Noah’s Ark, that time when He started to rain, only the lower animals were shielded from the rain.

This is a #GreatStorm. There is a problem plaguing humanity and threatening continued life on the planet. This storm will change life on the planet, historically the Creator and the SotC enjoy an approval rating above 99%.

#Mission23 was to address, amongst other things, three of the top four causes of death in humans, but that has been paused to address a rapidly rising cause of death: the CIA and their counterparts around the world.

The militaries of the world provide intelligence along with the necessary checks and balances to prevent tyrants typically. These non-government, for-profit intelligence outfits are killing indiscriminately anyone that their customers (not always a government) pay them to.

The SotC have now lost everyone they’ve ever known and even those who just knew their names. Now to cover it up, the CIA is killing anyone who asks about someone missing. Nearly all the victims were erased, no bodies left behind (chemically cremated). Some deaths were further hidden from family, friends and colleagues through an impersonation program that created a “hotel” from the victim’s life that the CIA would have employees or contractors move into to steal everything they left behind.

We do not know when we, The Servants of the Creator, will be told to resume our mission but it will be soon. Remember our approval rating and know that He wants us all to “live and let live” and have lots of fun doing it. ]

# Why is it called The Great Storm

Listen to longtime friend of Micah, Mark Charles Heidinger of Vandaveer in "Nature of our kind."  In this universe you don't become a point of light until you're dead--something the Creator doesn't want you to do.  The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church is only the tip of the iceberg, Micah keeps wondering where the true Mark Charles Heidinger, along another mother to Micah, Mrs. Heidinger, Mark's dad or brother is. All of these lives have been cut short, because of what Gilead Sciences considered a cure to HIV.  Gilead Sciences was able to bring in other major players in the pharmaceutical industry, who paid to kill of the cure for every disease known to man and everyone they deemed worthy of death.
