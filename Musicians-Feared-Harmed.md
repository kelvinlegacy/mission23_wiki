The CIA hates the messages some music sends. After a guided tour listening to Prince and Vandaveer, any artist or group that Micah selects and plays practically becomes a target.

This list is being made after hearing in a custom-made song (lyrics above) that Ida Corr was murdered. The CIA has produced a lot of music throughout this entire tragedy that displays their pride in taking lives for money. 

Recently the world learned Tina Turner’s death, she died suddenly (without the public hearing of an illness or fear of death) but the news of her death came exactly one day after “Proud Mary” was played in Micah’s apartment and he used her intro to explain how “We never do anything ‘nice and easy’.”

Regardless of how much Micah let everyone know it wasn’t an official creation by the Creator, Turner’s death was announced.
