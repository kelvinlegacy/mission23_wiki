# BREAKING: 

Much like _"Able Danger"_ was the blueprint for 9/11.  _"Surprise, Kill, Vanish"_ was the blueprint used by the CIA for Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  They haven't vanished though, she ("Hurricane Annie") keeps coming back for more SURPRISE attacks that are KILLing mourners of the previously VANISHed's funerals.  It's all right there on their [website](https://www.cia.gov/static/Review-Surprise-Kill-Vanish.pdf).  If the link breaks, we suspect it will quickly, don't worry, we have it--in multiple public places.

_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY is the site of the United States’ largest massacre ever, the largest massacre to occur within a church ever, and it continues today in an a systematic effort by the CIA and the US government to cover it up using mock funerals of those killed in the massacre.  Today's victims are not always affiliated with the church, nor the victims of the first Sunday attack.

More than 125 men, women and children were killed that Sunday, and over 1,000 lives in total have been killed. 

services sent a message from her mobile device to a team waiting outside to start the operation.

## "Where The Distance Makes The Difference"

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, KY.  The church is in a remote area of Lexington with very low traffic and very few, if any, routine police patrols.

The church’s motto is: _Where the distance makes the difference._

The city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. Its address implies city, however, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a remote area called Pricetown. (See [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZgjiHDMm8bGsM2e7?g_st=ic))

## The First Sunday

The massacre started on Sunday April 2, 2023 when men and women of the CIA, led by Annie Jacobsen, executed an attack based on tactics written by Jacobsen in her book, "Surprise, Kill, Vanish."  A review of the book can be found on the CIA's [website](https://www.cia.gov/static/Review-Surprise-Kill-Vanish.pdf), a copy is stored in our repository and can be viewed [here](Review-Surprise-Kill-Vanish.pdf) . 

According to the Creator, Annie Jacobsen along with "Michael Blackmon" attended morning services and shortly before the end of the morning session, Jacobsen sent a message to a team waiting outside to start the attack.

## Defenseless Victims

CIA personnel quietly blocked the two back exits located in the men and women’s rest areas, the door between each rest area and the sanctuary is always closed during services (this may not be evident in the charade videos). Then approximately fifty men and a handful of women gathered in the vestibule (a small gathering room designed to prevent interruption of services by late arrivals) and on the front steps undetected by the congregation. 

![Floorplan of Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/blob/master/assets/floorplan.png)

A projection was then displayed on every stained glass window of the sanctuary. The projection made it appear as though dozens of men were standing outside of each window blocking it. 

The already startled congregation then heard a female’s voice, instructing everyone to remain seated and that this was a law enforcement action.  A loud noise caused most of the congregation to jump and turn towards the back of the church towards the vestibule where they then seen the invading force of the CIA. 

Many of the congregants attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered, but not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government. The CIA utilized mobile cellular equipment, commonly called a COW (Cell On Wheels), which redirected calls to 911 to call takers’ mobile phones. Callers provided address information, a description of the activity inside and call back numbers and were told emergency services were en-route and hung up on. 

Members of the congregation were pulled to the front of the church, in a two by two manner, and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 

The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which had chemicals added to the existing water to chemically cremate them. 

### “Frying Chicken”

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA and others as “Frying Chicken.” 

Just as chicken that is frying can seemingly fight you back (with hot grease splattering), so can human beings when their sanctuary is invaded and lives threatened.

## Massacre Preparations 

Micah, then Kelvin Williams, was arrested for shoplifting in Riverdale, GA in the early morning hours of April 2nd, 2023. Charges for shoplifting were never filed. 

He was booked into Clayton County jail, in a scene that he calls, “unique.” There were practically no other detainees which he seen in booking for a county that is rather large, has a huge police presence, and holds the world’s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL).

During booking, a well choreographed event, he encountered the CIA’s typical harassment jokes, torment, a TomTom lookalike, a “TB skin test” unlike any he’d ever had before that caused a small bleed. The material that escaped was so weird he tried to keep it with his property on a gauze pad sealed in a tied rubber glove for review outside of the jail. The jail refused to let him place it in his about to be sealed property bag (which wouldn’t be opened again except by him upon release). 

Finally, a strip search tailor-made for him. No body cavity search performed, just a front and center visual inspection by at least three CIA employees, one posing as a guard, the other two inmate trustees. 

After booking Micah walked with another CIA employee posing as an inmate unescorted through the entire length of a long service corridor to an housing unit at the far end. Once there was shown to an already overcrowded two-man cell, told to sleep on the floor between the perpendicular to the toilet against the wall, his body was partially exposed but head and torso under the lower bunk. 

Micah spent the night in a cell, with constant visitors, with gnats and similar sized flying and crawling insects, chemicals smells he couldn’t identify the source of, and possibly gases. The Creator confirmed for Micah, the arrest was just an elaborate hit. Micah says, they had an art installation made under the bed, but could never really make out the scene. 

Shortly before noon, Micah estimates, he was rushed out of Clayton County, encountering not a single true inmate through the entire process and handed over to a waiting DeKalb County Sheriff’s Deputy. After being placed in his SUV Micah started the long (when under attack) ride to DeKalb County Detention Center. 

While the Deputy appeared to verify the warrant, Micah again endured a sustained attack from either cloaked individuals whom he could not see or from outside and/or above the vehicle. Micah seen and felt numerous lasers. The lasers are not for pointing, but killing. Micah has experienced them before beginning in the Des Moines airport, where he was hit in the heart by what appeared to be a passing traveler.

## The Ongoing Massacre 

The church was partially rehabbed and videos were produced to portray a sense of normalcy. Visitors to the church anytime the church has been opened since have been murdered. 

[[https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/blob/master/assets/mcbc_front.jpg|alt=MCBC]]

This screen capture obtained from the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church Facebook page (see warning below) clearly shows the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and the impersonated Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III wearing no pastoral robe and tennis shoes during a Sunday morning worship session. 

![IMG_0116](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/be070c92-e082-4714-8148-7c9bbaa50656)

Missing in this photo is our piano (on the left) and our organ (on the right, the organ in the choir stand is much smaller and is located in other places in later videos), they have been removed and pews from the back wall of the church put in their place. Also the choir, the choir stands have been wrecked and mostly empty--men randomly hang out there in the videos the charade church is producing now. The altar and lectern are new, made from a much lower quality wood, the altar was sized to fit between the two out of place pews. Mount Calvary Baptist Church would have never advertised its web address on the lectern. 

The replacement altar inscription is missing two words: “DO THIS” [IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME].

## The "Church" Today

The blood spilled on the first day of the massacre was cleaned for the most part and the church made presentable enough for video production.

Actors were hired to aide in the production of video and convey a since of normalcy at the church.  The videos and sermons, which are distributed on Facebook (see warning below), clearly show the actors are atheist and have no experience with Christian worship.

### "Grilling Chicken"

The massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church continues and is referred to by the CIA as “Grilling Chicken.” It was given this moniker due to the fact that people are murdered as they arrive to services at the church, which is far more subdued than the first Sunday since victims arrive and are killed in much smaller groups.

In addition to Sunday services, the CIA has held funerals at the church for those initially slain and persons contacting the church looking for their loved ones are contacted back advising them of a funeral date and time. 

## Political Actors

The CIA added the “Missionary” because of the missions that Micah has told them he runs for the Creator. 

The CIA must erase the family of Micah and Micah himself. As Micah is one person who has stated clearly he would allow anyone (including a foreign country) who have similar losses in an area (everyone disappearing within a day) to investigate the loss of his family in Sandy Hook, TN. A simple investigation would show a method of genocide that is so quick, effective and undetectable that people that are being killed have no idea it’s happening. Micah’s family were all on a Zoom videoconference on new cell phones with new SIM cards and an unidentified employee of the CIA, which secretly owns Zoom, making screen grabs. They were so busy looking at a manufactured cloud, they never noticed the plane. 

The NSA and FBI are active in covering up the CIA’s actions and preventing Micah from getting the word out. 

The NSA abuses its technical powers to eavesdrop on Micah and Thomas. They provide technical support to the CIA in numerous ways, including the COWs to divert calls to 911 and the personnel (often contractors who don’t know who they’re working for) to answer them. The NSA uses some of the Facebook and Social Media accounts of Micah’s friends to further torment him. 

Stuart Bruner is a friend of Micah’s and currently missing. His posts always reflect discussions held in Micah’s private apartment where Stuart has never been. 

![IMG_0210](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/50d14430-ff55-4fc0-ad1c-b51ad13e37b1)

The FBI uses their “top law enforcement agency in the land” to obtain, disclosed then make disappear any missing persons report and the person(s) who filed them. 

According to the Creator, the President is aware of the ongoing massacre and is thinking of his political career instead of his citizens. He’s briefed daily by the CIA on the matter. He’s aware the FBI and NSA have devoted personnel to covering up the entire matter. President Biden has authorized the use of military force in the US against in at least two areas. 

## The Charade Continues 

The CIA has learned, from eavesdropping and in-person surveillance of his apartment that their charade is very easy to recognize by anyone who’s ever attended church regularly. In an effort to improve it, they have had their actors studying footage of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

![IMG_0122](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/edf1b789-6ba3-405a-b1c6-aa15dfd3b7eb)

The church has began using the choir stands and purchased a piano, but has no pianist. There are a lot of videos from 2017-2019 that were not on the Facebook page a couple of weeks ago. However, the videos still show the large signs in the choir stands with Mount abbreviated “Mt” and the choir is sitting on folding chairs. 

They also realized they had to do something to counter the actions taken by Micah in his initial letter since Rev. Williams never submitted to the requested oral swab for DNA testing to prove his identity. 

After hearing Micah say, “To become a member of Mount Calvary one has to get in their ass in the baptismal, there’s simply no other way.” The CIA removed the chemical cremation from the baptismal, installed a first of its kind seat, and begin baptizing new members. 

[[https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Photos/Baptism.JPG|alt=Baptism]]

Upon seeing this photograph on their Facebook page, Micah almost lost his mind. 

It took him a while to realize how they could get it so wrong and then he figured it out. Sermons, weddings, funerals and even communion services have been videotaped in the past. But at Mount Calvary, Micah says, “Everything about baptisms is old fashioned, there’s no instrumentation just one old spiritual is sung. I doubt anyone ever videotaped one. Further, if pictures are taken, they’d be taken from the front, not the service entrance (entry/exit on the side) to the baptismal.” (He’s intentionally withholding the name of the song, and refuses to sing it.)

Micah adds about the baptisms of late, “The family pictured on Facebook looks eerily like my uncle, aunt, and their grandchildren. All of which did not go to church and they are all missing today.” He adds, “Yes, I said it’s a family operation… But not all of the family participated.”

## Continuing the Massacre
### Sunday Services

According to the Creator, Mount Calvary Baptist Church is attended by CIA employees and contractors on Sundays who capture and kill anyone who enters the church.  

The videos produced for Facebook are made on other days of the week and published on Sundays.  The SotC warn (see below) against viewing the videos or going to the Facebook page of "Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church" and cautions anyone who views the timestamps as true, the CIA modifies the timestamps of the posts to show activity on days and years different from the actual time taken or posted.

### Funerals

The SotC have learned that at least ten funerals were held at Mount Calvary Baptist Church but they were held to kill any person who came to pay their respects.  The funerals are not announced in the obituaries and are not for any one person.

Anyone who calls the church inquiring about a missing loved one is told of their funeral.  The funeral date is given and when the mourner arrives at the church they are killed.  This is being done to silence anyone with a missing friend or loved one.  The SotC advise everyone to not call the church, and only attend a funeral after verifying the death with a minimum of 1) the hospital or coroner, 2) a reputable funeral home, 3) an obituary in the Lexington-Herald Leader, and 4) the cemetery where they are to be interred.  

### 40th Pastoral Anniversary

The CIA conducted an effort to eliminate any remaining associates of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and used this Pastoral Anniversary celebration to attract those who have not yet been killed.  Micah viewed the photographs posted on Facebook and wrote an [open letter](Pastoral-Anniversary.md) (warning: language) to the CIA after noticing the choir and the award presenters.  Actresses who looked like Micah's mother, niece and sister were photographed in well placed positions in the choir stand, and the actresses bearing a resemblance to his mother and sister were photographed presenting awards.  Micah was informed by the Creator that his mother and sister, along with her children, his three nieces, were murdered by the CIA in October of 2023.

Micah has said several times that the church was a "family operation" and believes the CIA used this "Pastoral Anniversary" as a way to validate the charade and it's impersonators.  Micah's mother and sister had been living in Alabama, active members of a very large church.  The church's name is being withheld intentionally.

Micah couldn't help but to notice the pastor at the lectern, that actor bear a strong resemblance to a much heavier Micah,                                       the one most in central Kentucky would remember.

The Creator advises the photoshoot was held on Saturday before the announced event.  Regardless of the SotC's efforts to warn the publc, about 50 people were killed at the church on Sunday August 20, 2023.  The CIA's cycle continues as they located and killed all of those who filed missing persons reports for victims killed at the church who visited for the Pastoral Anniversary.

Micah expressed concerns for the impersonators resembling himself and family, the CIA according to the Creator has killed every one they've ever hired.   

### Emmanuel Baptist Church
![IMG_0120](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/25a652c1-87b0-45c9-b19c-cb806f07e4f4)

The address for the church shown at the top of this flyer is 4742 Todds Road.  The CIA which has no respect for the significance of Mount Calvary to Christians routinely abbreviates the "Mount" in Mount Calvary.  It also uses 4743 Todds Road for Mount Calvary, which is reported by Apple and Google Maps as the Mount Calvary Baptist Church Cemetery across the street.  Additionally, the flyer shows "Todd's" (note the apostrophe) Road, a common auto correction but something true members of Mount Calvary Baptist Church never allow to happen.  

The Creator hears every prayer.  Regardless of the name the person praying is praying to, because all prayer lines go straight to the Creator.  The Creator does not share your prayers with His servants unless you specifically pray for Him to do so, or He knows it was your actual intent to get one of us a message.

The Creator will provide to His servants information necessary to do their tasks for Him, including what Micah calls "aggregate prayer information."

When looking into the 40th Anniversary Micah asked the Creator, "Have you **ever** received a legitimate prayer from the pastor or a member of Emmanuel Baptist Church which has a reported address of 3815 West Broadway in Louisville, KY?"

The Creator responded: No.  

## Motive

While the operation's name is rooted in racism and racial epithets were used during the massacre Micah does not believe, and the Creator has confirmed, it was not racially motivated.  The massacre at Mount Calvary was continuing a cover up of the CIA’s misdeeds in Sandy Hook, TN.  In order to never have those misdeeds known, the CIA has to completely erase Micah’s family and anyone who may know them.    

Micah’s mother, Patricia Ann Crawley Williams, was a longtime member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and very active there. For a long time she was on the usher board and read the church announcements, putting her in front of thousands of worshipers over the years both from Mount Calvary and visiting congregations. 

## Taking Back The Church

When Micah (born: Kelvin Eugene Williams), a lifelong member of the Mount Calvary Baptist Church, learned of the massacre he immediately wrote a letter to his pastor the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.  The correspondence and actions of the CIA before and after the initial letter clearly indicate that they in fact did conduct the massacre.

To write the first letter Micah visited a public library in Riverdale, GA on May 5th, 2023.  While using a public computer, Micah had numerous attempts on his life, his letter was modified before his eyes by someone (he believes the NSA) using an administrator's session of VMWare Horizons (a PCOIP platform).  At 14:30 EDT He left the library at the Creator's instruction as military aircraft were approaching.  It ia the policy of the Creator that the SotC never flee danger, however He instructed Micah to do so due to the number of lives that could have been lost in the library and the apartment complex behind it.  The letter was completed the following day at Atlanta's Central Library while Micah was surrounded by CIA personnel and additional attempts to take his life were made.

The purpose of the first letter was to take control of the church, name a interim pastor to invite law enforcement in the Commonwealth of Kentucky into the church to investigate the massacre, additionally Micah wanted to ensure that no other persons visiting Mount Calvary Baptist Church would be harmed since it was apparent to him and the Creator advised him that it was still being used to capture and kill any members who were not present on the first Sunday.

### Correspondence

The correspondence between Micah and the CIA's ran church follows, the SotC has placed copies of it in the repository which you can, and should, view by clicking the link below the summaries.

* Micah writes to Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III 
    - Expressed concern for the church.
    - Took action as member, objecting to property transfers.
    - Removed pastor, associate pastors and deacons until DNA test.
    - [[Read the Letter (PDF)]](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230506-LetterToMCBC.pdf)

* "Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III" of Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. responds to Micah.
    - _"Word Soup"_ at the beginning of letter doesn't sound like anything ever said at the church.
    - Letterhead shows: a visiting choir in the choir stand, an open baptismal, and the top of the original organ it its original place. [[Logo (PNG Image)]](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/blob/master/assets/Letterhead.png)
    - [[Read Letter (PDF)]](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230506-ResponseToKEW.pdf)
    
* Attorney Yavon L. Griffin sends a Cease & Desist to Micah. 
    - [[Read the Letter (PDF)]](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230526-CeaseAndDesist.pdf)

* Micah responds to Attorney Yavon L. Griffin. 
    - [[Read the Letter (PDF)]](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230629-ResponseToCeaseAndDesist.pdf)

* Micah was served with an Order of Protection.
    - [[Read Order (PDF)]](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230731-ReceivedOOP.pdf)

Micah was served an [Order of Protection](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230731-ReceivedOOP.pdf) by an individual who appeared to be law enforcement.  Micah believes the Order of Protection is falsified, it was served merely seconds after he committed some data to the public respository and was unable to find any court date in online searches.  Furthermore, Micah, who was raised in Nicholasville, KY (next door to Lexington) is unaware of a Fayette County Sheriff, since all of Fayette county is Lexington and there's only the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, and the Lexington Police Department is the only law enforcement he's ever known there.

## Warning 

The Servants of the Creator (SotC) recommend that no one visit the church or church property until we announce that we have taken control of it. Furthermore, we recommend individuals do not view anything from the  church on Facebook as views may be tracked and reported to the CIA.

When the SotC have taken control of the church, an announcement will be here on this article.  Before the SotC take control of the church, you will have heard this on the evening broadcast news around the world, and there will have been earthquakes from the [ringing of the bell.](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell)

The Creator says that if your loved one was last known to be heading to church service at Mount Calvary Baptist Church or Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church and they didn't return, that you should NOT file a missing persons report until this has been reported widely (seen on every evening news broadcast).  He furthers stating that law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have provided the names of those reporting missing persons to the CIA, and the CIA has _investigated_ the reporter.
 
If any member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church reads this, DO NOT GO TO THE CHURCH. DO NOT CALL THE CHURCH. Everyone, including the Creator, agrees the best thing to do is to deny any relationship with, or knowledge of the church to anyone that asks. Micah says, "If you know the church, you know who's parked where, you know you can see that from afar.  YOU KNOW, he's always there early.  DO NOT GO ONTO CHURCH PROPERTY IF YOU DO NOT SEE HIM PARKED IN HIS SPOT.  Don't accept a new car, don't fall for it (they do read this too), I'll post here when he has given me the DNA test (it's oh so simple--my mom did it long ago!) that I asked of him to prove his identity.  It ain't Felix."

Once the SotC announce they have taken control of the property it will be safe to visit. Sadly, the church has seen its last worship session.

***  
_**Editor’s Notes:** The narrative you have read is true. If you do not believe it, you need to pray to ask if it’s true if you still don’t believe it, call the Kentucky State Police and asked them  the average number of people who typically go missing a month in Kentucky and then ask him how many African-Americans went missing Sunday, April 2, 2023 from the Lexington area._

_The City of Lexington and Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government should not be blamed or called.  They did not know about the first day of the massacre, their PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point / 911 Call Center) never received a call, all calls were diverted using temporary cell towers.  When Micah wrote his letter to the church, he copied law enforcement and the media.  The CIA wasted no time and were faster than e-mail, they told recipients that he was crazy and suffering from delusions, etc to make the letter really seem like the product of someone having a paranoid fantasy.  Please don't call them._
