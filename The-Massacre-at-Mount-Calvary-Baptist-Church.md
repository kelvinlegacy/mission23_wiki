_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, KY is the site of the United States’ largest massacre ever, and is ongoing. 

## Frying Chicken

The massacre started on April 2, 2023 when the CIA stormed the church near the end of the morning worship session. 

CIA personnel quietly blocked the two back exits located in the men and women’s rest areas, then approximately fifty men and a handful of women gathered in the vestibule undetected by the congregation. 

A projection was then displayed on every stained glass window of the sanctuary. The projection made it appear as though dozens of men were standing outside of each window blocking it. 

The already startled congregation then heard a female’s voice, instructing everyone to remain seated and that this was a law enforcement action.  A loud noise caused most of the congregation to jump and turn towards the back of the church towards the vestibule where they then seen the invading force of the CIA. 

Many of the congregants attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered, but not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government. The CIA utilized mobile cellular equipment, commonly called a COW (Cell On Wheels), which redirected calls to 911 to call takers’ mobile phones. Callers provided address information, a description of the activity inside and call back numbers and were told emergency services were en-route and hung up on. 

Members of the congregation were pulled to the front of the church, in a two by two manner, and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 

The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which had chemicals added to the existing water to chemically cremate them. 

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA as “Frying Chicken.” Due to the resistance they encountered from congregants as they fought back for their lives. 

## Grilling Chicken

The church was partially rehabbed and videos were produced to portray a sense of normalcy. Visitors to the church anytime the church has been opened since have been murdered.

This screen capture obtained from the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist website clearly shows the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and the impersonated Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III wearing no pastoral robe and tennis shoes during a Sunday morning worship session. 

Missing in the photo, our piano (on the left) and our organ (on the right) they have been removed and pews from the back wall of the church put in their place. Also the choir, the choir stands have been wrecked and mostly empty--men randomly hang out there in the videos the charade church is producing now. The altar and lectern are new, the altar sized to fit between the two out of place pews. Mount Calvary Baptist Church would have never advertised its web address on the lectern. 

The massacre continues and is referred to as “Grilling Chicken.” It was given this moniker due to the fact that people are murdered as they arrive or in smaller more manageable groups. 

In addition to Sunday services, the CIA has held funerals at the church for those initially slain and persons contacting the church looking for their loved ones are contacted back advising them of a funeral date and time. 

## Same Church, New Name & Denomination
