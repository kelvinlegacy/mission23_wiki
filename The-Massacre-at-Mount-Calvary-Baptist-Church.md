_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

This screen capture obtained from the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist website clearly shows the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and the impersonated Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III wearing no pastoral robe and tennis shoes during a Sunday morning worship session. 

Missing in the photo, our piano (on the left) and our organ (on the right) they have been removed and pews from the back wall of the church put in their place. Also the choir, the choir stands have been wrecked and mostly empty--men randomly hang out there in the videos the charade churches are producing now. The altar and lectern are new, the altar sized to fit between the two out of place pews. Mount Calvary Baptist Church would have never advertised its web address on the lectern.
