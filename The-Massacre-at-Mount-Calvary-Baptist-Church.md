_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, KY is the site of the United States’ largest massacre ever, and is ongoing. 

The city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. Its address implies city, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a remote area called Pricetown with very little traffic and practically no routine police patrol activity. The church’s motto is: _Where the distance makes the difference._ (See [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZgjiHDMm8bGsM2e7?g_st=ic))

## Frying Chicken

The massacre started on April 2, 2023 when the CIA stormed the church near the end of the morning worship session. 

CIA personnel quietly blocked the two back exits located in the men and women’s rest areas, then approximately fifty men and a handful of women gathered in the vestibule undetected by the congregation. 

A projection was then displayed on every stained glass window of the sanctuary. The projection made it appear as though dozens of men were standing outside of each window blocking it. 

The already startled congregation then heard a female’s voice, instructing everyone to remain seated and that this was a law enforcement action.  A loud noise caused most of the congregation to jump and turn towards the back of the church towards the vestibule where they then seen the invading force of the CIA. 

Many of the congregants attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered, but not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government. The CIA utilized mobile cellular equipment, commonly called a COW (Cell On Wheels), which redirected calls to 911 to call takers’ mobile phones. Callers provided address information, a description of the activity inside and call back numbers and were told emergency services were en-route and hung up on. 

Members of the congregation were pulled to the front of the church, in a two by two manner, and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 

The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which had chemicals added to the existing water to chemically cremate them. 

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA as “Frying Chicken.” Due to the resistance they encountered from congregants as they fought back for their lives. 

## Grilling Chicken

The church was partially rehabbed and videos were produced to portray a sense of normalcy. Visitors to the church anytime the church has been opened since have been murdered.

This screen capture obtained from the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church Facebook page (see warning below) clearly shows the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and the impersonated Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III wearing no pastoral robe and tennis shoes during a Sunday morning worship session. 

Missing in the photo, our piano (on the left) and our organ (on the right, the organ in the choir stand is much smaller and is located in other places in later videos) they have been removed and pews from the back wall of the church put in their place. Also the choir, the choir stands have been wrecked and mostly empty--men randomly hang out there in the videos the charade church is producing now. The altar and lectern are new, the altar sized to fit between the two out of place pews. Mount Calvary Baptist Church would have never advertised its web address on the lectern. 

The massacre continues and is referred to as “Grilling Chicken.” It was given this moniker due to the fact that people are murdered as they arrive to services at the church. 

In addition to Sunday services, the CIA has held funerals at the church for those initially slain and persons contacting the church looking for their loved ones are contacted back advising them of a funeral date and time. 

On August 13, Micah sent out a plea for help on GitHub using commit messages. Previously he’d used Facebook friends of friends to thwart another attack on a church. But since then the CIA has hijacked his Facebook and all other social media. He had to turn to GitHub and they have faced increasing pressure to kill everything he’s stored in repos. But he suspected another funeral was about to occur as a minder showed up as his other minder had to go to “work” out of town.

The grill doesn’t look like it was used at all.

These images were taken outside of a “Company” (what the CIA often refers to itself as to hide its true identity) office in Riverdale, GA, near where Micah lives (by forced circumstance). He’s had numerous attempts on his life as he’s walked by this location along Hwy 85. 

He suspected and the Creator confirmed it was an announcement seeking workers for the August 13th grilling at Mount Calvary. Micah suspects the grill being left out means they are planning another. 

Micah believes they’ve found a new church based on the sender of the $5 rent payment (an insult) his “roommate” (who is really a minder) just sent him. 

He believes the owner of the CashApp account is Duke Stone of Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN. Duke has not returned calls any of Micah’s calls and he always does. 

The Creator never advises His servants about the future or anyone’s thoughts or prayers, unless they have desired theirs to be shared or forwarded to the servants. 

## The "Church" Today

The blood spilled on the first day of the massacre was cleaned for the most part and the church made presentable enough for video production.

When Micah (born: Kelvin Eugene Williams), a lifelong member of the Mount Calvary Baptist Church, learned of the massacre he immediately wrote a letter to his pastor the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.  The correspondence and actions of the CIA before and after the initial letter clearly indicate that they in fact did conduct the massacre.

To write the first letter Micah visited a public library in Riverdale, GA.  While using a public terminal, Micah had numerous attempts on his life, his letter was modified before his eyes by someone (he believes the NSA) using an administrator's session of VMWare Horizons (a PCOIP platform).  He left the library at the Creator's instruction as military aircraft were approaching.  The Creator instructed him to do, due to the number of lives that could have been lost in the library and the apartment complex behind it.

The letter was completed the following day at Atlanta's Central Library while Micah was surrounded by CIA personnel and additional attempts to take his life were made.

* "Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III" of Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. responds to Micah, denying the allegations and is extremely out-of-character to Micah. [[Letter (PDF)]](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230506-ResponseToKEW.pdf). Micah often apologizes when reading the response, he says “The _word soup_ at the beginning of the response should have come with air sickness bags.” He urges readers to pay attention to the choir stand in the church’s letterhead. It shows a visiting choir (since the regular choir is always on the left during services), an open baptismal (normal, it was never covered), and the top of the original organ it it’s original place can be seen. The logo must have been Mount Calvary’s logo just before the massacre.

Micah was also served with an Order of Protection [[Order (PDF)]](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230731-ReceivedOOP.pdf) by an individual who appeared to be law enforcement.  Micah believes the Order of Protection is falsified, it was served merely seconds after he committed some data to the public respository and was unable to find any court date in online searches.  Furthermore, Micah, who was raised in Nicholasville, KY (next door to Lexington) is unaware of a Fayette County Sheriff, since all of Fayette county is Lexington and there's only the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, and the Lexington Police Department is the only law enforcement he's ever known there.

The CIA has learned, from eavesdropping and in-person surveillance of his apartment that their charade is very easy to recognize by anyone who’s ever attended church regularly. In an effort to improve it, they have had their actors studying footage of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

They also realized they had to do something to counter the actions taken by Micah in his initial letter since Rev. Williams never submitted to the requested oral swab for DNA testing to prove his identity. 

After hearing Micah say, “To become a member of Mount Calvary one has to get in their ass in the baptismal, there’s simply no other way.” The CIA removed the chemical cremation from the baptismal, installed a first of its kind seat, and begin baptizing new members. 

[[https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Photos/Baptism.JPG|alt=Baptism]]

Micah lost his mind. 

It took him a while to realize how they could get it so wrong and then he figured it out. Sermons, weddings, funerals and even communion services have been videotaped in the past. But at Mount Calvary, Micah says, “Everything about baptisms is old fashioned, there’s no instrumentation just one old spiritual is sung. I doubt anyone ever videotaped one. Further, if pictures are taken, they’d be taken from the front, not the service entrance (entry/exit on the side) to the baptismal.” (He’s intentionally withholding the name of the song, and refuses to sing it.)

Micah adds about the baptisms of late, “The family pictured on Facebook looks eerily like my uncle, aunt, and their grandchildren. All of which did not go to church and they are all missing today.” He adds, “Yes, I said it’s a family operation… But not all of the family participated.”

## Blame Game
Micah learned, after the CIA first tried to tell him that his white brother-in-law was involved with the assault on Mount Calvary and after hearing locals in Riverdale talk about how racism played a role there (they are unaware of the true number of victims—they’re told ten died). Riverdale seems to be a testing ground for explanations. 

Micah does not believe and the Creator has confirmed, it was not racially motivated. It was continuing a cover up of the CIA’s destruction of Orr Chapel and the murder of its members in Sandy Hook, TN, the digging up of two graveyards there and the nearly complete erasure of the Rogers and Crawley families in Sandy Hook, along with the Hawkins and Williams families in SW Kentucky around Guthrie, the still-living Micah is a problem for them. 

The CIA added the “Missionary” because of the missions that Micah has told them he runs for the Creator. 

## Warning 

The Servants of the Creator recommend that no one visit the church or church property until we announce that we have taken control of it. Furthermore, we recommend individuals do not view anything from the church on Facebook as views may be tracked and reported to the CIA. 

If any member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church reads this, DO NOT GO TO THE CHURCH. DO NOT CALL THE CHURCH. Everyone, including the Creator, agree the best thing to do is to deny any relationship with or knowledge of the church to everyone. Once TSOTC announce they have taken control of the property it will be safe to visit. Sadly, the church has more than likely seen its last worship session. Micah will meet with any member and vote on its future, at the present, it will likely have every surface covered so that visitors can’t destroy it (Micah calls this “putting it under glass.”), they will want to come pay their respects.
