_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, KY is the site of the United States’ largest massacre ever, and is ongoing. 

The city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. Its address implies city, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a remote area called Pricetown with very little traffic and practically no routine police patrol activity. The church’s motto is: _Where the distance makes the difference._ (See [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZgjiHDMm8bGsM2e7?g_st=ic))

Please note:  The City of Lexington and Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government should not be blamed or called lambasted.  They did not know about the massacre, their PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point / 911 Call Center) never received a call, all calls were diverted using temporary cell towers.  When Micah wrote his letter to the church, he copied law enforcement and the media.  The CIA wasted no time and were faster than e-mail, they told recipients that he was crazy and suffering from delusions, etc to make the letter really seem like the product of someone having a paranoid fantasy.  Please don't call them.

## The Initial Massacre 

The massacre started on April 2, 2023 when the CIA stormed the church near the end of the morning worship session. 

CIA personnel quietly blocked the two back exits located in the men and women’s rest areas, then approximately fifty men and a handful of women gathered in the vestibule undetected by the congregation. 

A projection was then displayed on every stained glass window of the sanctuary. The projection made it appear as though dozens of men were standing outside of each window blocking it. 

The already startled congregation then heard a female’s voice, instructing everyone to remain seated and that this was a law enforcement action.  A loud noise caused most of the congregation to jump and turn towards the back of the church towards the vestibule where they then seen the invading force of the CIA. 

Many of the congregants attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered, but not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government. The CIA utilized mobile cellular equipment, commonly called a COW (Cell On Wheels), which redirected calls to 911 to call takers’ mobile phones. Callers provided address information, a description of the activity inside and call back numbers and were told emergency services were en-route and hung up on. 

Members of the congregation were pulled to the front of the church, in a two by two manner, and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 

The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which had chemicals added to the existing water to chemically cremate them. 

### “Frying Chicken”

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA and others as “Frying Chicken.” 

Just as chicken that is frying can seemingly fight you back (with hot grease splattering), so can human beings when their sanctuary is invaded and lives threatened.

## The Ongoing Massacre 

The church was partially rehabbed and videos were produced to portray a sense of normalcy. Visitors to the church anytime the church has been opened since have been murdered.

This screen capture obtained from the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church Facebook page (see warning below) clearly shows the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and the impersonated Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III wearing no pastoral robe and tennis shoes during a Sunday morning worship session.

Missing in this photo is our piano (on the left) and our organ (on the right, the organ in the choir stand is much smaller and is located in other places in later videos), they have been removed and pews from the back wall of the church put in their place. Also the choir, the choir stands have been wrecked and mostly empty--men randomly hang out there in the videos the charade church is producing now. The altar and lectern are new, made from a much lower quality wood, the altar was sized to fit between the two out of place pews. Mount Calvary Baptist Church would have never advertised its web address on the lectern. 

The replacement altar inscription is missing two words: “DO THIS” [IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME].

### “Grilling Chicken”

The massacre continues and is referred to as “Grilling Chicken.” It was given this moniker due to the fact that people are murdered as they arrive to services at the church. 

In addition to Sunday services, the CIA has held funerals at the church for those initially slain and persons contacting the church looking for their loved ones are contacted back advising them of a funeral date and time. 

On August 13, Micah sent out a plea for help on GitHub using commit messages. Previously he’d used Facebook friends of friends to thwart another attack on a church. But since then the CIA has hijacked his Facebook and all other social media. He had to turn to GitHub and they have faced increasing pressure to kill everything he’s stored in repos. But he suspected another funeral was about to occur as a minder showed up as his other minder had to go to “work” out of town.

The grill doesn’t look like it was used at all.

These images were taken outside of a “Company” (what the CIA often refers to itself as to hide its true identity) office in Riverdale, GA, near where Micah lives (by forced circumstance). He’s had numerous attempts on his life as he’s walked by this location along Hwy 85. 

He suspected and the Creator confirmed it was an announcement seeking workers for the August 13th grilling at Mount Calvary. Micah suspects the grill being left out means they are planning another. 

Micah believes they’ve found a new church based on the sender of the $5 rent payment (an insult) his “roommate” (who is really a minder) just sent him. 

He believes the owner of the CashApp account is Duke Stone of Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN. Duke has not returned calls any of Micah’s calls and he always does. 

The Creator never advises His servants about the future or anyone’s thoughts or prayers, unless they have desired theirs to be shared or forwarded to the servants. 

## The "Church" Today

The blood spilled on the first day of the massacre was cleaned for the most part and the church made presentable enough for video production.

When Micah (born: Kelvin Eugene Williams), a lifelong member of the Mount Calvary Baptist Church, learned of the massacre he immediately wrote a letter to his pastor the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.  The correspondence and actions of the CIA before and after the initial letter clearly indicate that they in fact did conduct the massacre.

To write the first letter Micah visited a public library in Riverdale, GA.  While using a public terminal, Micah had numerous attempts on his life, his letter was modified before his eyes by someone (he believes the NSA) using an administrator's session of VMWare Horizons (a PCOIP platform).  He left the library at the Creator's instruction as military aircraft were approaching.  The Creator instructed him to do, due to the number of lives that could have been lost in the library and the apartment complex behind it.

The letter was completed the following day at Atlanta's Central Library while Micah was surrounded by CIA personnel and additional attempts to take his life were made.

    - [[Order (PDF)]](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230731-ReceivedOOP.pdf)

Micah was served an [Order of Protection](https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Correspondence/20230731-ReceivedOOP.pdf) by an individual who appeared to be law enforcement.  Micah believes the Order of Protection is falsified, it was served merely seconds after he committed some data to the public respository and was unable to find any court date in online searches.  Furthermore, Micah, who was raised in Nicholasville, KY (next door to Lexington) is unaware of a Fayette County Sheriff, since all of Fayette county is Lexington and there's only the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, and the Lexington Police Department is the only law enforcement he's ever known there.

## The Charade Continues 

The CIA has learned, from eavesdropping and in-person surveillance of his apartment that their charade is very easy to recognize by anyone who’s ever attended church regularly. In an effort to improve it, they have had their actors studying footage of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

![IMG_0122](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/edf1b789-6ba3-405a-b1c6-aa15dfd3b7eb)

The church has began using the choir stands and purchased a piano, but has no pianist. There are a lot of videos from 2017-2019 that were not on the Facebook page a couple of weeks ago. However, the videos still show the large signs in the choir stands with Mount abbreviated “Mt” and the choir is sitting on folding chairs. 

They also realized they had to do something to counter the actions taken by Micah in his initial letter since Rev. Williams never submitted to the requested oral swab for DNA testing to prove his identity. 

After hearing Micah say, “To become a member of Mount Calvary one has to get in their ass in the baptismal, there’s simply no other way.” The CIA removed the chemical cremation from the baptismal, installed a first of its kind seat, and begin baptizing new members. 

[[https://github.com/Mission23/mcbcmf/blob/base/assets/Photos/Baptism.JPG|alt=Baptism]]

Upon seeing this photograph on their Facebook page, Micah almost lost his mind. 

It took him a while to realize how they could get it so wrong and then he figured it out. Sermons, weddings, funerals and even communion services have been videotaped in the past. But at Mount Calvary, Micah says, “Everything about baptisms is old fashioned, there’s no instrumentation just one old spiritual is sung. I doubt anyone ever videotaped one. Further, if pictures are taken, they’d be taken from the front, not the service entrance (entry/exit on the side) to the baptismal.” (He’s intentionally withholding the name of the song, and refuses to sing it.)

Micah adds about the baptisms of late, “The family pictured on Facebook looks eerily like my uncle, aunt, and their grandchildren. All of which did not go to church and they are all missing today.” He adds, “Yes, I said it’s a family operation… But not all of the family participated.”

## Other CIA Churches
![IMG_0120](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/25a652c1-87b0-45c9-b19c-cb806f07e4f4)

## Motive
Micah does not believe and the Creator has confirmed, it was not racially motivated. 

The massacre at Mount Calvary was continuing a cover up of the CIA’s misdeeds in Sandy Hook, TN.  

In order to never have those misdeeds known, the CIA has to completely erase Micah’s family and anyone who may know them. 

Micah’s mother, Patricia Ann Crawley Williams, was a longtime member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and very active there. For a long time she was on the usher board and read the church announcements, putting her in front of thousands of worshippers over the years both from Mount Calvary and visiting congregations. 

The CIA added the “Missionary” because of the missions that Micah has told them he runs for the Creator. 

## Warning 
The Servants of the Creator recommend that no one visit the church or church property until we announce that we have taken control of it. Furthermore, we recommend individuals do not view anything from the  church on Facebook as views may be tracked and reported to the CIA. 
 
If any member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church reads this, DO NOT GO TO THE CHURCH. DO NOT CALL THE CHURCH. Everyone, including the Creator, agrees the best thing to do is to deny any relationship with, or knowledge of the church to anyone that asks. 

Once the SOTC announce they have taken control of the property it will be safe to visit. Sadly, the church has more than likely seen its last worship session.
