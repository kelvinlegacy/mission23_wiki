This is a special interest page for Georgia Tech. It is so that we can provide you with any information we think you need to know. (This is just supposed to be notes)

# Introduction 
“Armageddon. I never thought I would bring it to Georgia Tech. I was just trying to warn students they were in danger by taking a gig that seemed harmless enough,” said Micah. 

The gig was a *“see someone, say something”* task on TaskRabbit. However, the gig is actually an attempt at mind control, the actual customer is the Central Intelligence Agency, and the target is considered someone the CIA must eliminate, and anyone who even sees him or recognizes his face, in their minds, must be eliminated too. 

The CIA, contrary to popular belief, which works almost exclusively inside the country never intended on paying taskers, but make  them disappear. 

Now that the word is out, GA Tech has been invaded by the CIA and the U.S. Federal Government. Their behavior is what many would consider “death throes,” and dangerous for students. 

The purpose of this article is to provide safety information, report information, and occasionally ask for assistance. These asks are completely voluntary, but will help the entire country and world. “This is a revenge of the nerds and the Supreme Engineer, the Creator,” Micah says. 

# #StudentWatch
The Creator is highly engaged against the CIA and the federal government’s appetite for killing innocent people. 

To keep students and others safe around GA Tech and Midtown we encourage you to take a moment and pray or think about any interaction with someone new, especially gigs. Then *go with your gut.* 

If someone is ringing your doorbell at 5am and you just feel like pretending you’re not home—-do just that!  Even without prayer or thinking, if you get a strong feeling about something, especially like someone is nearby you can’t see (read: cloaks), *don’t fight the feeling.* 

# Overall Advice 
* Remain calm.
     - You’ve done nothing wrong.      - Know that the Creator has this under control. 
* Stay clear of me. 
     - It’s a danger zone. We can meet later but I’m a moving target. Also they’ve killed people they just thought I spoke to. 
     - I’ll post a photo here of me and TomTom after quakes. I’ll look different. 
* Do not modify your beliefs
     - The Creator doesn’t mind what they are—-He does consider atheism a religion though. 
* Don’t talk online about this
     - The NSA is actively working to silence this too. 
     - IMMEDIATELY STOP USING WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. 
     - Use Wire, the Creator only allows us to use it. 
* Do talk about this with others
     - In person or by voice/video calls with others off-campus and around the country 
     - Never use Zoom (it’s the CIA’s and they’re likely watching)

* If you hear booms, stay calm, He’s got this
* If you see the military on the ground or in the sky, don’t worry
* If you haven’t, read about [the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church)
* DO NOT REPORT ANYONE MISSING UNTIL YOU’VE TOLD EVERYONE YOU WILL BE DOING THAT! (See article above!)
* See Guidance below (for specific departments/groups)

# Revenge of the Nerds
## Assistance Needed
Micah could use some help proving some things.
* Nerds who know git
    - Clone and fetch often: https://github.com/MCBCMF/MCBCMassacre 
     - Tell others to do the same (offline)
* Any non-git nerd
     - Download a copy of the repo above often. Click the green Code button in the Code/files section. 
     - Tell others to do the same (offline)
* Physics nerds?
     - You guys and gals can help or identify the nerds to help the police and others on campus see or at least detect people cloaked. [See this](https://www.army-technology.com/features/military-camouflage-technology-us-russia/) for a starter. 
     - I’m in midtown. They are always surrounding me. Gear up, pick a spot around the square, hit me on Wire (see Contact info) and I’ll walk through a few times. I hate this shit!!!
* Geological Nerds
    - Watch that seismographs.
* Campus Security /GATech Police
     - Look for this. Dead leaves in the middle of healthy trees. That’s a good indicator of a tree mounted poison dispenser. These are remote controlled. Look for guns too. This one at corner of Williams & Abercrombie.

* Well Connected Inter-Collegiate Nerds
     - Below is a picture of my Katrina Renee Duvall. She went to Auburn and Tuskegee. Maybe you all can find some of her friends and see what they think of the second pic.

## Reporting Findings
Any students or faculty that looks into anything we report or request should work with their departments to create a composite student/faculty member or use a pseudonym that is not linked to one person. 

Network/IT should support this by sharing the login and never sharing access details for emails, etc. 

Anonymity is highly recommended. 

Anyone who wants to simply share their findings with us should see the contact page. We only use Wire, He will not allow anything else. Use the profile linked on the contact page. We will report it and take the heat. We will give you credit when the story breaks. 

### E-Mail
The use of Wire is encouraged by the Creator. Micah’s Wire profile can be [found here](https://account.wire.com/user-profile/?id=1CFBE1AC-E293-40D5-A38F-1E165D3DE50D).

If you must use email, send your findings to: contact@theservants.info 

# Warnings
## Them
GA Tech has a culture, and the CIA has a culture too. The two collide. It’s very easy to spot. Stay away from them. 

**They tend to _”work”_ early mornings, be extremely cautious between the hours of 3am and sunrise. They are generally cloaked.**

## This Backpack
It could be the new trend. But today’s trend for me is that everyone wearing one HAS TRIED TO KILL ME.

# Guidance 
## Network Administrators 
* Refer all requests for information to this page and section. Period. Per the Creator. 
* To the Federal Government: “Fuck you. Strong reply to follow.” - Your Creator, the Creator. 
* To the CIA: He has elected to just ignore you. See above. 

## GATech Police
* Anonymize any missing persons reports. Now!!!
* He is watching you. He knows which ones of you are double dipping with the CIA. Those of you who are should call in sick!
* Do not let them access any video recordings or camera systems. Pull them off the Internet. 

## Buzz Card Office
* Do not issue a Buzz Card for Kelvin Eugene Williams. He’s an alumni (from 2013, ATDC). That’s Micah’s government name and the government has impersonators and his ID. 

# Things Micah Sees
![IMG_0830](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/assets/140252803/621cbae7-aedc-4245-adda-81c34e229fcd)
When did my old office building get police stationed in the lobby?!?! His hand is on the gun. It’s really not that serious.

Ask the FBI about shooting me. 

The dangers to this campus are all the new people invading it trying to kill me. Like these guys down where I smoke!!! Just 100 feet from you. 

![IMG_0831](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/assets/140252803/462f9ab9-f6e0-4d9e-aa6b-846772aeabe1)

Or maybe in the loading dock. If He wasn’t taking care of this campus, and Atlanta, hell this nation He’s tried to save twice before… You “Mr. I’m Gonna Kill Micah” and hundreds of thousands of others would be dead right now. 

That was a nuke nerds. I watched the blast as I walked by. If history is a judge, they’ll do it again and again. They like their suitcases, those friends of the CIA (read: KGB).

# Thanks!
If I want to take your photo, it’s really to prevent them from making you disappear. The Creator makes me do this. 

Thanks to this guy who works at the book store tech shop. He restored my bricked iPhone, he simply plugged it into a Mac and let it lay there for 20 minutes or so.
