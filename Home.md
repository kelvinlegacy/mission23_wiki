# Welcome to SotC.wiki

This is a public-access educational/informational wiki maintained by the Servants of the Creator, Micah and TomTom. This wiki will cover topics related to the Servants of the Creator’s (SotC) Mission #23 on Earth.

The Servants of the Creator were hired by the Creator over six billion years ago and are sent anywhere in His creation (called the “universe” here on Earth, although His creation doesn’t end there—-there’s way more) where life exists and its continued existence is threatened or could be improved. 

## Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church

Until enough of "We, the People" of the United States have pressured the federal government to stop the pressure on the Commonwealth of Kentucky to forget what they've seen, ignore what they've heard, and say nothing about [the Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church), this wiki is currently being used to get information out to all interested parties. This is an ongoing massacre, the articles herein may not meet the standards of Wikipedia or media outlets, but we hope to fix that when time permits--suggestions and edits welcomed, please submit anonymously for the time being.

## Why GitHub?

Micah gets it, he's even added some code in the newest repo--Micah understands why you would ask that very question. In short, git. The longer version, everything these days pulls from GitHub. If someone compromised his stuff again, people around the world who had already cloned it and pull regularly--whom they cannot identify--would know what happened. Micah logged into several IRC networks, the biggest nerd channels and in one message (to avoid bans) begged nerds to clone it. They did. He was starting his own Revenge of the Nerds...

GitHub because of README.md and built-in repo navigation and file viewer, it makes it easy to create a "website" for this type of stuff quickly, and Micah needed that. There's added security in the fact that nearly everything pulls from GitHub. Even TomTom! The NSA didn't want to mess with GitHub, it would essentially be screwing itself. Public repos are free, Micah is broke (temporarily) and well... PUBLIC! Everybody needs to look at it, and most importantly read the correspondence.

Micah created the "MCBCMF" user account and secured it with a complex password and 2FA, all while using a demo phone at the Apple store. Granted permissions to his personal account to collaborate and made to sure to delete everything (passwords and 2FA). With this two account (one forever locked on purpose) configuration, the onlu way to change the repo is by commit.  The entire world can see every single change--just in case they try to hide it once public.  Then began committing everything he had regarding his home church. He had no other choice, because he was in Apple because of a low-tech hack  that rendered him "iPhone Unavailable" and just screwed.

## The Great Storm

The start of #Mission23 has been delayed while the Creator storms. Immediately after [the quaking under our feet](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell) finishes we are going to work.
