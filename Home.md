# Welcome to sotC.wiki

Youâ€™ve reached the Servants of the Creator mission23 wiki either because of [the Massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-of-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) or because the Creator decided to *ring the bell* and **you felt it** (the bell is planet Earth), and you want to know more about [the ringing of the bell](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell).

## Pray To Verify 
#PrayToVerify is a hashtag used by the Servants of the Creator in online forums.  Readers of information posted by one of the Servants should pray to verify its authenticity and/or truthfulness whenever they doubt it. 

The verification process is very simple.  Pray to the "God" you were first taught to pray to, in the manner you were first taught and ask: "Is this true?" or "Is this from one of your servants?"   

The Creator urges everyone pray to verify anyone they are told or think is one of His servants, or anything one of His verified (to you by Him only) servants tells you or you read online. There are numerous operations ongoing by both the CIA and the federal government to discredit us and cover up their  activities.

If you do not pray, simply think very hard: "Is this true?"

## Most Content Offline
The Creator wants everyone to know that He has instructed us, His servants, to take offline or hide as much content as possible so that hopefully everyone focuses on only one thing: [The Massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-of-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) 

Content will be coming back at His direction, hopefully within a month.
