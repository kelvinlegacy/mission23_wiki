Welcome to the #Mission23 wiki. 

This wiki will cover topics related to The Servants of the Creator’s mission on Earth.

The Servants of the Creator were appointed by the Creator over six billion years ago and are sent anywhere in His creation (called the “universe” here on Earth, His creation doesn’t end there—-there’s way more) where life exists and its continued existence is threatened or could be improved. 

The wiki is currently being used to get information out to all interested parties. We know, the articles do not meet the standards of Wikipedia, we hope to fix that when time permits. 

Currently https://CIAKill.site and https://CIAMassacre.site are forwarded here to disseminate information about the cause of the #GreatStorm. 

# Great Storm Statement

#Mission23 has been sidelined while the Creator storms on. 

The Creator does not ever intervene in human events. Ever. Once humans decide to do something, they will do it. When blocked or prevented by an unseen force, human nature is to escalate their actions. 

We see escalations all the time. When you’re hammering a nail and it doesn’t go in, you swing the hammer harder, change your grip, and sometimes end up a hammering your thumb. 

Another reason He doesn’t is… Where does it stop? He help one situation, He must help them all. When we have perfection everywhere, there’s no reason to live. Utopias sound great on paper, but in practice they bring an end to the Creator’s vision. All conscious entities actually need something to focus on, to fix, so that we want to wake up tomorrow. 

From time to time the Creator will “rain” things down. Force things to go in His vision. For example, nuclear war in the 60s—that was really a light misting. But the right people got to the right positions and “cooler heads” prevailed. Without that misting, Earth would be a different place today. 

This is not a misting or a rain, nor the flood in Noah’s Ark. This is a #GreatStorm. There is a problem plaguing humanity and threatening continued life on the planet. #Mission23 was to address, amongst other things, three of the top four causes of death in humans, but that has been paused to address a rapidly rising cause of death, the CIA and their counterparts around the world. The militaries of the world provide intelligence and checks and balances against aggression typically. These non-government intelligence outfits are killing indiscriminately anyone that their customers (not always governments) pay them to. 

The TSOTC have lost practically everyone they’ve ever known. Now to cover it up, the CIA is killing anyone who asks about someone missing. Nearly all the victims were erased, no bodies left behind, and some impersonated to steal from their rightful heirs. The TSOTC are not alone, just alive to tell their stories.
