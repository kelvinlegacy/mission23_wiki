# Welcome to SotC.wiki
This is a public-access educational/informational wiki maintained by the Servants of the Creator, Micah and TomTom.  This wiki will cover topics related to the Servants of the Creator’s (SotC) Mission #23 on Earth.

## Why GitHub?
Micah gets it.  Micah understands why you would ask that very question.  In short, git.  The longer version, everything these days pulls from GitHub.  We apologize to GitHub for the NSLs and shit they have to deal with from the government for this one, free account.  The Creator (also known as, "Allah", "God" and many other Supreme names) is actually monitoring them around the clock too--physically (life & limb) and technically.  

Micah, born Kelvin Williams, had Facebook almost as long as Facebook has been in existence (@kelvinewilliams), Twitter since it opened to the general public (@kelvinewilliams), Google+ from early beta (kelvinewilliams), GitHub he was very late to the party, forced to go by textPlus, but it's his only place to hangout now...  Plus git.  He is banned as soon as he creates an account.  Any post regarding Mount Calvary Baptist Church or the larger tragedy is suppressed or deleted.  

Micah created the "MCBCMF" user account and secured it with complex password and 2FA, all while using a demo phone at the Apple store.  Granted permissions to his personal account to collaborate and made to sure to delete everything (passwords and 2FA).  Then began committing everything he had regarding his home church.  He had no other choice, because he was in Apple because of a low-tech hack that rendered him "iPhone Unavailable" and just screwed.

The Servants of the Creator were hired by the Creator over six billion years ago and are sent anywhere in His creation (called the “universe” here on Earth, although His creation doesn’t end there—-there’s way more) where life exists and its continued existence is threatened or could be improved.

## Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church
Until enough of "We, the People" of the United States have pressured the federal government to stop the pressure on the Commonwealth of Kentucky to forget what they've seen, ignore what they've heard, and say nothing about the [Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church), this wiki is currently being used to get information out to all interested parties.  This is an ongoing massacre, the articles herein may not meet the standards of Wikipedia or media outlets, but we hope to fix that when time permits--suggestions and edits welcomed, please submit anonymously for the time being. 

## The Great Storm 

The start of #Mission23 has been delayed while the Creator storms. Immediately after the quaking finishes we are going to disappear for a short working vacation. 

The Creator does not ever intervene in human events. Ever. Once humans decide to do something, they will do it. When blocked or prevented by an unseen force, human nature is to escalate their actions. 

We see escalations all the time: When you’re hammering a nail and it doesn’t go in, you swing the hammer harder, change your grip, and sometimes end up an injuring yourself. 

Another reason He doesn’t is… Where would it stop? He help one situation, He must help them all. When we have perfection everywhere, there’s no reason to live. Utopias sound great on paper, but in practice they bring an end to the Creator’s vision, which is life. All conscious entities actually need something to fix or improve, so that we want to continue living and creating future generations. 

From time to time the Creator will “rain” things down. Force things to go the way they need to. For example, nuclear war in the 60s—that wasn’t rain, but a light drizzle.  The right people got into the positions needed and “cooler heads” prevailed. Without that drizzle,  Earth would be a different place today, probably devoid of life. 

The #GreatStorm is not drizzle or rain, nor the flood in Noah’s Ark. 

To understand the Biblical flood, one must understand arks are not boats, they are messages or a lesson (think: the Ark of the Covenant, no boat). The takeaway from Noah’s Ark, that time when He started to rain, only the lower animals were shielded from the rain. 

This is a #GreatStorm. There is a problem plaguing humanity and threatening continued life on the planet. This storm will change life on the planet, historically the Creator and the SotC enjoy an approval rating above 99%. 

#Mission23 was to address, amongst other things, three of the top four causes of death in humans, but that has been paused to address a rapidly rising cause of death: the CIA and their counterparts around the world. 

The militaries of the world provide intelligence along with the necessary checks and balances to prevent tyrants typically. These non-government, for-profit intelligence outfits are killing indiscriminately anyone that their customers (not always a government) pay them to. 

The SotC have now lost everyone they’ve ever known and even those who just knew their names. Now to cover it up, the CIA is killing anyone who asks about someone missing. Nearly all the victims were erased, no bodies left behind (chemically cremated). Some deaths were further hidden from family, friends and colleagues through an impersonation program that created a “hotel” from the victim’s life that the CIA would have employees or contractors move into to steal everything they left behind. 

We do not know when we, The Servants of the Creator, will be told to resume our mission but it will be soon. Remember our approval rating and know that He wants us all to “live and let live” and have lots of fun doing it.
