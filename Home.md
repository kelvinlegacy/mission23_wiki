# Welcome to SotC.wiki

The Servants of the Creator were put to work by the Creator over six billion years ago, and are sent anywhere in His creation where life exists and its continued existence is threatened or the quality thereof could be improved.

This is a public-access wiki maintained by the Servants of the Creator, Micah and TomTom. This wiki will provide background and the latest topics related to the Servants of the Creator’s (SotC) Mission #23 on Earth. 

The primary purpose of this wiki is to provide their web developers with a single, reliable source for the SotC website. 

Non-Editor Editor’s Note: I am no Jill Erwin (of Turner in Atlanta), I’ve written the bulk of the content here under extreme stress at times, I’m under constant physical, psychological, and technical attack.

Although I live in a rent free apartment at Legacy at Riverdale in Riverdale, GA (I think they are telling me something with that name). I literally have the CIA, FBI, and NSA trying to kill me, set me up, arrest me, make gruesome art of missing people in my life, and hack or steal every device or link to the Internet I have. But “nothing happened there” is what they keep saying. 

I worked in telecom for nearly two decades. I railed against the NSL when it was first proposed. Now me, practically homeless, with no known living friends or family, no income or terror network am the cause of NSLs to GitHub, Apple, Google and probably more being prepared today. Everyone reading this page should ask themselves: [What could he possibly have here, on this GitHub Wiki that MUST be taken offline immediately?](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/wiki/Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church)  A paranoid write up/a work or fiction, or the only write up about the [worst atrocity](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/wiki/Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) in "[the greatest tragedy](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Greatest-Tragedy) mankind will ever face." (So said the Creator).

We are just gathering everything in one location for a new startup, The Mount Calvary Baptist Church Memorial Foundation, and I don’t have my friend Nanea Reeves to guide me, I know this not in her wheelhouse, I don’t even know if she went to church, but she definitely knows startups and has experience with a loss the public felt. She hasn’t answered my call in a while. She always does!

## The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church

The Creator has tasked His servants with ensuring the safety and security of everyone that visits Mount Calvary Baptist Church throughout the Mission.  Additionally, the servants were given permission, if they want, to establish a memorial foundation to restore and preserve the church as close as possible to the way it was the on the day of the [massacre](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/wiki/Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church). 

Micah is already on record as saying the church will become a memorial. The SotC have already established a memorial foundation for the massacre’s victims and the church itself. 

## The Great Storm

The start of #Mission23 has been delayed while the Creator storms. Immediately after [the quaking under our feet](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell) finishes we are going to start the #mission23. 

See [The Great Storm](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Great-Storm).
