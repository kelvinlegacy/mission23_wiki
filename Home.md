# That bump right there Christians!!!

That bump we felt during the 15:00 EDT hour on August 21, 2023...  That was Him...  Please hear what I got to say, I didn't know the bump was even coming until He did it...  Don't be stupid.  [Here's the audio file](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/blob/master/Warning-to-Christians-with-bump-from-God.m4a).  I'm working on something quickly for audio/video other than YouTube.

# Welcome to SotC.wiki

The Servants of the Creator were put to work by the Creator over six billion years ago, and are sent anywhere in His creation where life exists and its continued existence is threatened or the quality thereof could be improved.

This is a public-access wiki maintained by the Servants of the Creator, Micah and TomTom. This wiki will provide background and the latest topics related to the Servants of the Creator’s (SotC) Mission #23 on Earth. 

The primary purpose of this wiki is to provide their web developers with a single, reliable source for the SotC website. 

Non-Editor Editor’s Note: I am no Jill Erwin (of Turner in Atlanta), I’ve written the bulk of the content here under extreme stress at times, I’m under constant physical, psychological, and technical attack.

Although I live in a rent free apartment at Legacy at Riverdale in Riverdale, GA (I think they are telling me something with that name). I literally have the CIA, FBI, and NSA trying to kill me, set me up, arrest me, make gruesome art of missing people in my life, and hack or steal every device or link to the Internet I have. But “nothing happened there” is what they keep saying. 

I worked in telecom for nearly two decades. I railed against the NSL when it was first proposed. Now me, practically homeless, with no known living friends or family, no income or terror network am the cause of NSLs to GitHub, Apple, Google and probably more being prepared today. Everyone reading this page should ask themselves: [What could he possibly have here, on this GitHub Wiki that MUST be taken offline immediately?](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church)  A paranoid write up/a work or fiction, or the only write up about the [worst atrocity](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) in "the greatest tragedy mankind will ever face." (So said the Creator--entry coming ASAP).

I’m just gathering everything in one location for a new startup, The Mount Calvary Baptist Church Memorial Foundation, and I don’t have my friends Nanea Reeves to guide me I known this not in her wheelhouse, I don’t even know if she went to church, but she definitely knows startups and has experience with a loss the public felt. She hasn’t answered my call in a while. She always does!

## Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church

The Creator has tasked His servants with ensuring the safety and security of everyone that visits Mount Calvary Baptist Church throughout Mission.  Additionally, the servants were given permission, if they want, to establish a memorial foundation to restore and preserve the church as close as possible to the way it was the on the day of the [massacre](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church). 

Micah does not subscribe to everything taught to him by his mother, nor his church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church...  He is that motherfucker that does not really do forgiveness, accidents happen they are the only thing that can be forgiven, but they planned way too much to call this an accident.   

So, the [wiki entry](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church)   here is about the task.  Background must be provided for all SotC tasks, otherwise, the local creatures will claim we're invading and destroying their way of life.

## Why GitHub?

Micah, remember was born Kelvin Eugene Williams, has a long history of “internetting.” Starting when he’d sneak into the University of Kentucky’s library and used a “borrowed” (these would be airquotes if you were in the room with Micah—only the truth permitted on this wiki per the Creator, so really big air quotes) NeXTSTEP login to IRC and stuff. 

He had Facebook (@kelvinewilliams) and Twitter (@kelvinewilliams) and was even a Plusser (@kelvinewilliams), since the beginning of each, same account, all him until… It wasn’t this job, the CIA or NSA (or their “rusty guns for hire”) stole them, now is banned anywhere he creates a new account within minutes. He was on the Internet when pictures were rare finds in the wild and video nonexistent. While he learned to read (and write) early, he was late to the GitHub party. Driven there by force by his former boss and supervisor at textPlus, also not answering calls, Donovan Sydow. Who told him repeatedly, “commit often…” (let me commit this now—new readers coming every moment)

Micah gets it, he's even added some code in the newest repo--Micah understands why you would ask that very question. In short, git. The longer version, everything these days pulls from GitHub. If someone compromised his stuff again, people around the world who had already cloned it and pull regularly--whom they cannot identify--would know what happened. Micah logged into several IRC networks, the biggest nerd channels and in one message (to avoid bans) begged nerds to clone it. They did. He was starting his own Revenge of the Nerds...

GitHub because of README.md and built-in repo navigation and file viewer, it makes it easy to create a "website" for this type of stuff quickly, and Micah needed that. There's added security in the fact that nearly everything pulls from GitHub. Even TomTom! The NSA didn't want to mess with GitHub, it would essentially be screwing itself. Public repos are free, Micah is broke (temporarily) and well... PUBLIC! Everybody needs to look at it, and most importantly read the correspondence.

Micah created the "MCBCMF" user account and secured it with a complex password and 2FA, all while using a demo phone at the Apple store. Granted permissions to his personal account to collaborate and made to sure to delete everything (passwords and 2FA). With this two account (one forever locked on purpose) configuration, the onlu way to change the repo is by commit.  The entire world can see every single change--just in case they try to hide it once public.  Then began committing everything he had regarding his home church. He had no other choice, because he was in Apple because of a low-tech hack  that rendered him "iPhone Unavailable" and just screwed.

## The Great Storm

The start of #Mission23 has been delayed while the Creator storms. Immediately after [the quaking under our feet](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell) finishes we are going to work.

See [The Great Storm](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Great-Storm).
