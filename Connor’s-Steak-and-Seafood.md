Conor’s Steak and Seafood is a fake restaurant that serves death. Conor’s has opened nearly everywhere either of The Servants of the Creator have lived, worked, or visited, and they have had family, friends or colleagues disappear. 

Micah’s mother, Patricia Ann Crawley Williams, received a gift certificate there. 

These are the last known images of the them. They are shown as received. The images were cropped to remove CIA personnel that accompanied them to dinner, one of them Katrina’s new husband, “Jack.”

The image of Karrington and Katrina show three individuals in the background, “Brian”, Annie, and “Michael.” 

Micah knew Brian and Michael as homeless in Atlanta, but has since learned they are CIA employees. The image was taken at Conor’s in Huntsville, not far from where Micah’s mother and sister resided. 

The images were received when Micah demanded a video conference after receiving gruesome artwork in his bedroom depicting them beheaded. The individual pretending to be his sister said they were at dinner and sent these photos. 

His family has not been heard from despite repeated attempts to call even engaging local police in Alabama and his sister’s office where she was a probation officer for the State of Alabama.
