Sandy Hook, TN first appeared on maps in 1888. Located in Maury County, TN. 

It was an unincorporated city. Its current state/classification is in question. 

The Rogers and Crawley families lived in Sandy Hook, side by side, for over 100 years. 

The closeness got too close at least once resulting in the baby girl of the family, Patricia Ann Crawley Williams. She had two of her own children, Micah (born Kelvin Eugene Williams) and Katrina (“Kat” or “Trina”) Renee Duvall Torrain.
