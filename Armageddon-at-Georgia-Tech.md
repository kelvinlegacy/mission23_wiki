This is a special interest page for Georgia Tech. It is so that we can provide you with any information we think you need to know. (This is just supposed to be notes)

## Armageddon 
“I never thought I would bring it to Georgia Tech. I was just trying to warn students they were in danger by taking a gig that seemed harmless enough,” said Micah. 

You have been invaded by the CIA and the U.S. Federal Government. Their behavior is what many would consider “death throes.”

# Reporting Findings
Any students or faculty that looks into anything we report or request should work with their departments to create a composite student/faculty member or use a pseudonym that is not linked to one person. 

Network/IT should support this by sharing the login and never sharing access details for emails, etc. 

Anonymity is highly recommended. 

Anyone who wants to simply share their findings with us should see the contact page. We only use Wire, He will not allow anything else. Use the profile linked on the contact page. We will report it and take the heat. We will give you credit when the story breaks. 

## E-Mail
The use of Wire is encouraged by the Creator. Micah’s Wire profile can be [found here](https://account.wire.com/user-profile/?id=1CFBE1AC-E293-40D5-A38F-1E165D3DE50D).

If you must use email, send your findings to: contact@theservants.info 

# They’re Back
## BOLO and Stay Away From
### Them
GA Tech has a culture, and the CIA has a culture too. The two collide. It’s very easy to spot. Stay away from them. 

**They tend to _”work”_ early mornings, be extremely cautious between the hours of 3am and sunrise.**

### This Backpack
It could be the new trend. But today’s trend for me is that everyone wearing one HAS TRIED TO KILL ME.

# Older Stuffs

I am running around Midtown because I just don’t wanna live with the CIA who invaded my apartment posing as a friend. 

They have admitted to killing at least the pastor at Mount Calvary, but we all know they could have written that off. They killed every inside and are still killing. 

They gave me his ecclesiastical ring while boasting. They want it back, I cannot do that. 

They have invaded Tech again today, I’m trying to stay right here on the square to keep them here. 

Update: I was just kicked out of Barnes and Noble. 


### Things To Do
* Remain calm. You’ve done nothing wrong. 
* Know that the Creator has this under control. 
* Stay clear of me. It’s a danger zone. We can meet later but I’m a moving target. 
     - I’ll post a photo here of me and TomTom after quakes. I’ll look different. 
     - Have you modified your playlists yet? See the wiki. 
* Do not modify your beliefs. The Creator doesn’t mind what they are—-He does consider atheism a belief though, and some of you have actually turned it into a religion. 
* Trust no one you didn’t know a week ago. 
* DO NOT TAKE ANY GIGS that require you to “see someone, say something.” They are a mind control effort by the CIA and the pay is deadly. 
* We’ve done this before, only the bad actors hate it. 
* Tell everybody what you see. 
    - Take photos of any new companies you see on campus. Take them discreetly. We will provide a place to upload them later. 
* Read and share [this](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/wiki/Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church). That’s what all of this is about. 
* DO NOT REPORT ANYONE MISSING UNTIL YOUVE TOLD EVERYONE YOU WILL BE DOING THAT! (See article above!)
* If you hear booms, stay calm, He’s got this. 
* If you see the military on the ground or in the sky, don’t worry. 
* If you see non-Tech fake students, ignore them. Seriously, ignore them. Don’t talk to the CIA spooks!
* IMMEDIATELY STOP USING WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. Use Wire, the Creator only allows us to use it. 
* Do not post anything on Facebook or Twitter about this situation. Use Wire. 

### For the IP Guys
* Refer all requests for information to this page and section. Period. Per the Creator. 
* To the Federal Government: “Fuck you. Strong reply to follow.” - Your Creator, the Creator. 
* To the CIA: He has elected to just ignore you. See above. 

### GATech Police
* Anonymize any missing persons reports. Now!!!
* He is watching you. He knows which ones of you are double dipping with the CIA. Those of you who are should call in sick!
* Do not let them access any video recordings or camera systems. Pull them off the Internet. 

### Buzz Card Office
* Do not issue a Buzz Card for Kelvin Eugene Williams. That’s Micah’s government name and the government has lookalikes and his ID. 

### Nerd Assistance Needed
This is Revenge of the Nerds. Micah could use some help proving some things.
* Cloaking. 
    - Individuals can wrap themselves in an electromagnetic field that renders them invisible. You guys have the equipment to detect and even see them. Do it! And get all the proofs!!!
* Environmental 
     - There are numerous toxins being introduced. 
     - There may be some radioactive materials around too. 
     - Monitor the square and behind Centergy. 
* Geological Nerds
    - Watch those seismographs. Starting now!
* Anyone
     - Grab a copy of every profile pic on Facebook user kelvinewilliams. That isn’t mine anymore. All of my friends were killed. They’ve hired lookalikes to kill me today. You’ll see them everywhere. 
* Anyone
     - Watch them. Record them. 
     - I’m at Tech Square. If you see me, stay back, but watch them hit me. 
     - Look for people who go out of their way to throw away trash. 
     - Look for people who grab their cell phones (I’d pay to know what they are doing, I get shot and poisoned all the time and all I see is someone grabbing a phone). 
     - Lasers. Don’t think these are your professors lasers!!! 
     - Drops. They always drop stuff around me. Watch it. 
      - “shot callers” these guys call the more orchestrated hits. They are not always easy to see.
* Well Connected Inter-Collegiate Nerds
     - Below is a picture of my Katrina Renee Duvall. She went to Auburn and Tuskegee. Maybe you all can find some of her friends and see what they think of the second pic.

Again. I’m sorry for coming here. I think the boss is about to do something to liven up the place. 

If He does, can someone please message @micah23 on Wire and tell me where I can find the seismologists? I wanna see it. It’s gonna be epic. 

Btw. Someone tell the seismologists that they can be the first to pinpoint the epicenters. Faster than the computers if you use this [method of pinpointing](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell). THERE WILL BE NO DAMAGE, anyone experiencing fallout from their nuke? He’s good. 

## Things Micah Sees

When did my old office building get police stationed in the lobby?!?! His hand is on the gun. It’s really not that serious.

Ask the FBI about shooting me. 

The dangers to this campus are all the new people invading it trying to kill me. Like these guys down where I smoke!!! Just 100 feet from you. 

![IMG_0831](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/assets/140252803/462f9ab9-f6e0-4d9e-aa6b-846772aeabe1)

Or maybe in the loading dock. If He wasn’t taking care of this campus, and Atlanta, hell this nation he’s tried to save twice before… You “Mr. I’m Gonna Kill him” and hundreds of thousands of others would be dead right now. 

That was a nuke nerds. I watched the blast as I walked by. If history is a judge, they’ll do it again and again. They like their suitcases, those friends of the CIA.

## Thanks!
If I want to take your photo, it’s really to prevent them from making you disappear. The Creator makes me do this. 

Thanks to this guy who works at the book store tech shop. He restored my bricked iPhone.
