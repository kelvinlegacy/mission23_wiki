## Mitigating Micah
### The Frying Chicken Operation
According to the Creator, the CIA identified Micah as a potential threat to the massacre operation citing that he routinely warns individuals that he has learned may be active targets of the CIA in their attempts to eliminate all of his friends and family and decided that they must mitigate him prior to pursuing the operation and given he may possibly be alerted to the the plan.

Micah, who was born Kelvin Williams, was arrested for shoplifting in Riverdale (Clayton County), GA after shopping at the Texaco in the early morning hours of April 2nd, 2023. He was stopped while walking home. Charges for shoplifting were never filed. 

Micah says, “I am the righteous hand of God, and the devil you overlooked.” Meaning he simply does what he’s told to do by the Creator. Micah does not ever want anyone to think he is God, the Creator, or wants worship. “This works best when people don’t see me coming,” he says. 

He was booked into Clayton County jail, in a scene that he calls, “unique.” There were practically no other detainees to be seen in booking for a county that is rather large, has a huge police presence, and holds the world’s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL).

During booking, described by Micah as a well choreographed event, he encountered the CIA’s typical harassment jokes, torment through artwork of murdered friends and family and comments, a TomTom lookalike. He received a “TB skin test” unlike any he’d ever had before that caused a small bleed. The material that escaped was so weird he tried to keep it with his property on a gauze pad sealed in a tied rubber glove for review outside of the jail. The jail refused to let him place it in an about to be sealed property bag, which wouldn’t be opened again except by him upon release.

Finally, a strip search tailor-made for him. No body cavity search performed, just a front and center visual inspection by at least three CIA employees, one posing as a guard, the other two posing as inmate trustees. 

After booking Micah walked with another CIA employee posing as an inmate unescorted through the entire length of a long service corridor to an housing unit at the far end. Once there, he was shown to an already overcrowded two-man cell, told to sleep on the floor, between the toilet and the bottom bunk. His body was partially exposed but head and torso under the lower bunk. 

Micah spent the night in a cell, with constant visitors, with gnats and similar sized flying and crawling insects, a chemical smell he couldn’t identify or find the source of. The Creator confirmed for Micah, the arrest was just an elaborate series of hits. Micah says, they had an art installation under the bed, but could never really understand what it was depicting. 

Shortly before noon, Micah estimates, he was rushed out of Clayton County, encountering not a single true inmate through the entire process and handed over to a waiting DeKalb County Sheriff’s Deputy. After being placed in his SUV, Micah started the long ride to DeKalb County Detention Center. 

While the Deputy appeared to verify the warrant, Micah began enduring a sustained attack from either cloaked individuals, whom he could not see or from outside and/or above the vehicle. Micah seen and felt numerous lasers. The lasers are not for pointing, but killing. Micah has experienced them before beginning in the Des Moines airport, where he was hit in the heart by what appeared to be a passing traveler.

After arriving at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Micah asked the Deputy if he could use his mobile phone while still seated in the car.  He sent out a tweet and contacted Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation, one of the program managers who had assisted him while homeless with obtaining his free hotel room at the Motel 6 in Decatur and his rent-free for a year apartment at Legacy at Riverdale, to let her know that he was arrested and his dog was locked in his apartment.

According to the Creator, shortly after Micah was inside the detention center, Micah's program manager, Tracy, notified Jacobsen that Micah was in custody and secure.  That is when Jacobsen launched the attack, by sending a message using TextNow to the personnel waiting outside.

### Grilling Chicken Operations
Micah would have personnel of the CIA stop by as if they were friends for a visit, but refuse to leave and monitor all of his activities and limit his interactions with anyone apparently not on an approved guest list.

### September 13th, 2023
In the early morning hours of September 13, 2023 Micah requested that "Danny" leave his apartment.  A week earlier, Micah filed for a Temporary Protective Order against Danny and his associates whom the Creator says are all CIA personnel.  According to the posted policies of Clayton County Superior Court, any request that meets the requirements (which Micah's TPO Application did) will be completed and served the same day if it is received by 3p.m..  On the first day Micah's was rejected for not being signed, it was fixed and resubmitted with a request for a call back if there were any other problems and no call or email was received.  

Several days after the amended filing, Micah was awaken by Danny banging on his door.  He told him to go away and Danny then proceeded to bust his living room window and climb in ([YouTube Video of Break In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp3FW9r3O7w)).  Micah called 911, the police told him that he has a right to break into his apartment, Micah told them repeatedly he was not a resident.  The police made several unprofessional comments, laughed and left.

Micah who had become fed up by Danny's installation of gruesome artwork depicting his friends and family in their final moments, hearing Danny's boasting of raping and killing of his cousin, and Danny's endless stream of "friends" requested again that Danny leave.  Danny pretended to sleep, but Micah knew he was awake.  Micah splashed some water on Danny's face to rouse him from his false slumber and Danny got up and left the room.  As Micah repeated his requests for Danny to leave, Danny re-entered the room carrying a large stick with two butcher knives attached to one end.

Danny proceeded to swing the stick in Micah's direction at one point hitting Micah and breaking the stick.  Micah left the apartment around 6am and again contacted the Clayton County Superior Court around 9:45am regarding this requested Temporary Protective Order.  Court staff did not return his calls or e-mails.  

After returning home, Micah was awaken from a nap by a large police presence outside his apartment around 8pm.  The police came to the door, and were overheard discussing that the door to Micah's apartment appeared to have been recently kicked in.  The officer asked Micah to step outside.  Micah noted at least six police vehicles, and a fire truck.  The fire personnel were checking Danny.  The police officer first asked about a missing cell phone of Danny's, then asked Micah if he had splashed water on Danny.  Micah told him about the earlier event and admitted to trying to wake Danny with a splash of water.  Micah made sure to say that Danny was not harmed and proceeded to tell him about the incident with the knives and how he was trying in vain to get a protective order.  

The police arrested Micah for Simple Battery.  Micah was taken to Clayton County, during booking an incident report was read to Micah stating it was a "red chemical substance."  Micah was denied bail, although he had an audio recording of the arresting officer which he offered to play for the booking officer.  

Micah noted that Clayton County detention center was devoid of any obvious arrests of anyone who appeared to have broken even the most typical arrestable offense.  The holding cells were full of CIA personnel and "local contractors."  Micah started as he did in April a non-stop attempt on his life by numerous "inmates."  

Micah was given a $2,400 bail, but everyone seemed to know he was in for the long haul.  His next court date was October 10th.  Micah has zero people whom he could call, and all of Clayton County's law enforcement apparently knew it.  Micah does know, that several whom he was interacted with, including his arresting officer, helped remove the final people in his life, his church family at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

Micah settled in to cell 7306.  He realized the next day, he was in the exact same unit and cell as his previous arrest for "Shoplifting."

* Gilead Sciences started the larger tragedy after learning of a cure of HIV.  The patient, was a friend of Micah's who received a formula designed Creator.  Micah was gathering proof cases.  During a routine viral load test, Ken Mabry's test came back "Target Not Found."  He was interrogated intensely, and told them "my friend gave me something."
* Gilead Sciences paid $300,000 to a front company of the CIA to eliminate the problem--Ken and Micah (then Kelvin).
* Gilead Sciences was joined by other major players in the pharmaceutical industry when they learned of the cure, as it meant the end of disease in human beings.
* The Gilead Sciences led consortium to "cure the cure" has funded the entire tragedy and has paid for each and every life taken within the tragedy and at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.
* Micah has begged Gilead Sciences to hit him with a Cease & Desist numerous times publicly, so he could willingly violate it to be pulled into a courtroom.  Gilead refuses to do so.  The tweet below was showing them how another business, one which they are a partner in, had found a lawyer capable of sending one.  They still haven't sent a Cease & Desist.

* Incomplete whitewashing/scrubbing of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  
* There are inconsistencies with what Apple, Google, MapQuest, etc consider Mount Calvary's address vs the "Mt. Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc's" as shown on Facebook.

* The person posting this is not Stuart Bruner.  Stuart was a high school classmate of Kelvin / Micah's.  This is only to provide context into the "smallest pool" post of "Stuart's".  Micah was discussing how anyone in the Jessamine County High School 1993 could be verified as an actual student or resident of Jessamine County by asking them questions, which were:
    - "Who was your ride partner on Kick Bootie?"  
    - "What were the things the announcer said year after year?"
    - "What was the song that he always played?"
* Stuart would have never called the event the "Jessamine County Fair" as Kick Bootie was only in town every year for the "Jamboree," a lifelong resident of Jessamine County, we only know it as the "Jessamine Jamboree" or "Jamboree."  If they were to change the name a thousand times, true folks from Jessamine County only call it the "Jessamine Jamboree."
* The photo is not of the Jessamine Jamboree either, in fact the photo came from nowhere in Jessamine County.  The Jamboree was held in the parking lot of K-Mart, then Kroger.  We've never had a Food Depot in Jessamine County.

* Danny is not Micah, although recently he’s adopted the current Micah look and persona. 
* The Creator says that “‘Danny’ has the Kelvin Eugene Williams, Georgia driver’s license and has done numerous things with it to get Micah arrested. ‘Danny’ is CIA.”
* ‘Danny’ tells others he’s a roommate, he’s been told to leave numerous times. 
* ‘Danny’ told Micah he did not move in, and lived at least one other apartment at Legacy with “Chivy.” “Chivy” is a name that Annie Jacobsen uses around Legacy and when she met with Micah as a buddy/friend of “Antonio Banks.”
* “Danny” uses several different tactics to handle Micah daily, including:
     - Manipulating Micah’s subconscious;
     - Using Micah’s subconscious to cause physical changes to Micah’s body;
     - Using Micah’s subconscious to cause emotional damage to Micah;
     - Using Micah’s subconscious to obtain information from Micah, even while sleeping;
     - Controlling/limiting Micah’s interactions with others;
     - Controlling the flow of money to Micah, as his only source of money, his lodging fees—-currently over $300 owed but will not stop showing up or breaking in;
     - Controlling the flow of foods and other consumables, including illicit drugs;
     - Illegally spying or tapping his technical resources (locking phones, infecting phones and computers);
     - Creates, installs or delivers macabre artwork or threats against other CIA victims known to Micah;
     - Delivers personal effects of little or no value to Micah’s residence;
     - He does cook. Micah never eats it, because what won’t kill a human, is human. f92c5c3
     - Stealing items and swapping devices;
     - Studying and mimicking Micah;
     - Physical harm including murder.
