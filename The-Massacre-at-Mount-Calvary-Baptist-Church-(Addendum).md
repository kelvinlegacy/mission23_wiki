* Gilead Sciences started the larger tragedy after learning of a cure of HIV.  The patient, was a friend of Micah's who received a formula designed Creator.  Micah was gathering proof cases.  During a routine viral load test, Ken Mabry's test came back "Target Not Found."  He was interrogated intensely, and told them "my friend gave me something."
* Gilead Sciences paid $300,000 to a front company of the CIA to eliminate the problem--Ken and Micah (then Kelvin).
* Gilead Sciences was joined by other major players in the pharmaceutical industry when they learned of the cure, as it meant the end of disease in human beings.
* The Gilead Sciences led consortium to "cure the cure" has funded the entire tragedy and has paid for each and every life taken within the tragedy and at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.
* Micah has begged Gilead Sciences to hit him with a Cease & Desist numerous times publicly, so he could willingly violate it to be pulled into a courtroom.  Gilead refuses to do so.  The tweet below was showing them how another business, one which they are a partner in, had found a lawyer capable of sending one.  They still haven't sent a Cease & Desist.

* Incomplete whitewashing/scrubbing of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  
* There are inconsistencies with what Apple, Google, MapQuest, etc consider Mount Calvary's address vs the "Mt. Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc's" as shown on Facebook.

* The person posting this is not Stuart Bruner.  Stuart was a high school classmate of Kelvin / Micah's.  This is only to provide context into the "smallest pool" post of "Stuart's".  Micah was discussing how anyone in the Jessamine County High School 1993 could be verified as an actual student or resident of Jessamine County by asking them questions, which were:
    - "Who was your ride partner on Kick Bootie?"  
    - "What were the things the announcer said year after year?"
    - "What was the song that he always played?"
* Stuart would have never called the event the "Jessamine County Fair" as Kick Bootie was only in town every year for the "Jamboree," a lifelong resident of Jessamine County, we only know it as the "Jessamine Jamboree" or "Jamboree."  If they were to change the name a thousand times, true folks from Jessamine County only call it the "Jessamine Jamboree."
* The photo is not of the Jessamine Jamboree either, in fact the photo came from nowhere in Jessamine County.  The Jamboree was held in the parking lot of K-Mart, then Kroger.  We've never had a Food Depot in Jessamine County.

* Danny is not Micah, although recently he’s adopted the current Micah look and persona. 
* The Creator says that “‘Danny’ has the Kelvin Eugene Williams, Georgia driver’s license and has done numerous things with it to get Micah arrested. ‘Danny’ is CIA.”
* ‘Danny’ tells others he’s a roommate, he’s been told to leave numerous times. 
* ‘Danny’ told Micah he did not move in, and lived at least one other apartment at Legacy with “Chivy.” “Chivy” is a name that Annie Jacobsen uses around Legacy and when she met with Micah as a buddy/friend of “Antonio Banks.”
* “Danny” uses several different tactics to handle Micah daily, including:
     - Manipulating Micah’s subconscious;
     - Using Micah’s subconscious to cause physical changes to Micah’s body;
     - Using Micah’s subconscious to cause emotional damage to Micah;
     - Using Micah’s subconscious to obtain information from Micah, even while sleeping;
     - Controlling/limiting Micah’s interactions with others;
     - Controlling the flow of money to Micah, as his only source of money, his lodging fees—-currently over $300 owed but will not stop showing up or breaking in;
     - Controlling the flow of foods and other consumables, including illicit drugs;
     - Illegally spying or tapping his technical resources (locking phones, infecting phones and computers);
     - Creates, installs or delivers macabre artwork or threats against other CIA victims known to Micah;
     - Delivers personal effects of little or no value to Micah’s residence;
     - He does cook. Micah never eats it, because what won’t kill a human, is human. f92c5c3
     - Stealing items and swapping devices;
     - Studying and mimicking Micah;
     - Physical harm including murder.
