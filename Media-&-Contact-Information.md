## Media Re-Use
The Servants of the Creator currently maintain one online presence at: [https://github.com/mission23](https://github.com/mission23). Any and all visible content may be used for print, broadcast and online as long as quotes are used without modification and in context. The SotC have no other restrictions for use. 

### Styling Suggestions 
* It is important for a number of reasons that outlets always capitalize the C in “Creator” or “SotC”; and the H in “He” or “Him” whenever we have it stylized that way or when referring to the Creator. 
* He prefers to be referred to as, “the Creator,” so that no bias towards any belief or belief system is shown or inferred.  
* We prefer to just be called “the Servants” or “the Servants of the Creator” when referred to jointly; and “Servant of the Creator” or “SotC” used as a title after our name when used individually. 
* While we do not have strict rules, we ask that everyone follow the suggestions for the Creator. 
* The Servants don’t really mind what you call us, just don’t call us late for dinner. 

## Contact
### Allowed Mediums
* At the present time, the Creator only allows the use of Wire for any secure communication.
     - If you demand WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal, the SotC will recommend they talk to you using plain old telephone service, or your native SMS apps.  Because, the NSA is going to read it anyway.  (Insert joke about saving CPU cycles/energy here...  Nevermind, no savings potential.)

* Just find him at Hardee's.  He'll be the one whining about not having a flip phone available to him at the store.
