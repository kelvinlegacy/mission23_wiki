Genocide is the intentional destruction of a people in whole or in part. In 1948, the United Nations Genocide Convention defined genocide as any of five “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. These five acts were: killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children out of the group. Victims are targeted because of their real or perceived membership of a group, not randomly.

# The Bluegrass Genocide
The Bluegrass Genocide started with the African-American Christian population in Lexington, Kentucky, but has now spread to the overall Christian population in the central Kentucky area. 

## Onset of Genocide 
Attempted coverup of the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church marks the beginning of the genocide.

The plans for the cover-up included, holding funerals for the victims of the massacre. Individuals who contacted the church showing interest in finding their loved ones were later contacted back and notified of their loved one’s death and funeral services arrangements were provided to them. 

The funerals are being held at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, and dozens of funerals at any given time. Arriving mourners are killed upon entry to the church.

Each mourner killed caused new friends and family to call the church, and the cycle was repeated. 

Other ethnic groups are starting to feel the effects of the genocide and the primary targeted group appears to be Christian. Also affected ethnic groups include: Caucasians, Latinos, and Asians. The Bluegrass region of Kentucky is the most impacted, the death toll coming from all over North America. 

## Death Toll
There have been over 2000 deaths in the genocide. Victims may not be reported as dead due to other activities by the CIA to hide the deaths. 

## The Creator’s Involvement 
The Creator for the third time in human history has decided to become directly involved in human activities and stop this genocide. 

The Creator sees the future outcome and knows it must be stopped now. Objectives for the Creator’s mission23 for life on Earth have been updated to address this genocide.
