# History
Our forefathers came up the road from the 2nd Independent Baptist Church of Athens. Believing the Lord will make a way somehow on their hearts and minds, they traveled by horse and wagon to Pricetown to build Mt. Calvary Baptist Church. God gave them a vision and a dream of a church in their community. Guided by the Holy Spirit, with determination in their hearts, the church down the lane was built.

Their leader and first pastor was a family member.  Rev. Matthew Garner, who was affectionately known as “Uncle Matthias,” was a carpenter by trade and led the building process.  Meetings were held in home and an old school building until the church was completed.  Basket meeting were held on the church grounds to lift the name of the Lord in Thanksgiving and praise.
 
Rev. Garner was called home in 1912 after serving 31 years.  Rev. B.S. Rawlings was called to the Mt. Calvary pastoral ministry and served for 9 months.

Rev. William Alexander was called to lead the flock at Mt. Calvary in 1914. He faithfully served for 10 years. Our beloved Aunt Sue Fuller was baptized during his pastorate.  She provided a wealth of knowledge and wisdom.

On October 3, 1965, The Mt. Calvary Church burned to the ground.  With tears in our eyes and God on our side the vision to rebuild the church was born.  In the Spring of 1966 ground was broken for the new building. Bro Leonard Woods was part of the team working on the concrete work. The church building, we currently worship in was completed in November 1966

Under his pastorate, the church burned the mortgage, launched its bus ministry, and updated the church by padding the pews.  The church steeple and the organ were added through a gracious contribution on behalf of our cherished member, the Late Sis Elizabeth Ballard.
