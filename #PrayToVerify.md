#PrayToVerify is a hashtag used by the Servants of the Creator in online forums.  Readers of information posted by one of the Servants should pray to verify its authenticity and/or truthfulness.

The verification process is very simple.  Pray to the "God" you were first taught to pray to, in the manner you were first taught and ask: "Is this true?" or "Is this from one of your servants?"  Then see how you feel about it.  

The Creator urges everyone pray to verify anyone they are told or think is one of His servants, or anything one of His verified (to you by Him only) servants tells you or you read online. There are numerous operations ongoing by both the CIA and the federal government to discredit and cover up its activities.

If you do not pray, simply think very hard: "Is this true?"
