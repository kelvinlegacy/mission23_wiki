In 2001 they found the fireproof Passport, truth be known, they probably planted it too. Today they are sending undercover agents in alongside the artists, rapists and murderers of Micah’s friends, family, and church family,  forgetting entrapment and trying to make a case for bank fraud. 

The plan is simple. Cut Micah off everywhere. The CIA accomplished that for the most part over the past three years, even killing those who’ve interviewed me. They’re supplying friends who steal everything. A roommate who’s in Lexington every other week, looking like me, and never pays his rent. 

They are trying to create a bank fraud or depository account fraud case. The roommate showed up with tons of check stock, a printer and some smells-like-CIA “Check Writer” phone app. 

They sent a CIA operative and an undercover FBI agent in and seemingly tried to get Micah to say the right things, asking for “Chex Mix,” and other nonsense as if they were going to mix it altogether. 

Micah asked the undercover FBI Agent why they would be trying to concoct a case when there’s at least several counts of Wire Fraud they could charge people associated with Mount Calvary Baptist Church with. There was enough money in the coffers when the CIA walked in to run the church for years without another penny given to it, and by the next day they were flat broke. Some of those transactions to deplete everything went across wires in two different states. 

The pair left very quickly and didn’t return. The Creator and Micah understand what an “agent” is. That conversation was informing the US government of what it already knew. We know they discussed it that night and next day. Still not a word about Mount Calvary. 

In the words of your creator, the Creator, when you think you know what’s coming next… “Wait.” In the words of an old departed friend, “People ain’t never ready for act two.”
