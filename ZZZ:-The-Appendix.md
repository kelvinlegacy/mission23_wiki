Micah was told Chris (CJ) Marsili and his former boyfriend Preston Leonard were dead. Micah mentioned this in a commit message. 

Preston was seen online but never could meet with Micah despite repeated attempts, always a different excuse. Micah never spoke him by phone or video despite trying. 

Chris did meet with Micah after the announcement. They met in midtown and Chris was called away and had to leave so abruptly he ignored Micah yelling his name. 

Chris subsequently changed his profile photo (below, another ruler in the baptismal joke/threat). He has not been seen online in a while and not responding to any call or text from any number (even those unknown to Chrisâ€”-his business pretty much requires his responses to unknown numbers).
