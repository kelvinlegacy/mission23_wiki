_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

The article begins after the warnings.

## Always Pray to Verify 
On a personal note, we’ve never seen Him this angry. That’s over 6 billion years of service. He wants you to pray, and if you don’t pray, think really hard about any site you visit or information you consume about Mount Calvary Baptist Church. 

We use the hashtag [#PrayToVerify](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/%23PrayToVerify) a lot, that’s because some things are very hard to believe. But no one can make you feel any kind of way, He can and will when you ask Him to. 

* You are: 
     - Reading about a church that is located on Todds Road in Lexington, KY; or 
      - Reading anything about a church with “Mount Calvary” in its name in Lexington, KY; or 
      - you are going to a wedding or funeral somewhere on Todds Road in Lexington, KY. 

* You pray: 
      - “Heavenly Father, will you help and guide me.” 

* How you may feel: 
     - You suddenly hate everything about the website you’re on and you have the overwhelming desire to go to github.com, then search for “Mount Calvary” EVEN THOUGH you’ve never been on that site and the front page says it’s about everything except churches. 
     - You suddenly feel like, “I need to mow the yard and I really don’t wanna see them like that.”

* What should you do: 
     - **Don’t fight the feeling.**
     - Do exactly what you feel. 

Remember: No one on Earth can make you feel anything. No one.

For example: 
Micah and TomTom both say, “We got laundry to do. Why are none of you doing it??? A lot of truly dirty laundry. Just sitting there. We tell folks, maybe even try to guilt them with a tear. ITS STILL SITTING THERE. Why?”

A small church on Todds Road in remote Lexington, KY is the site of the largest massacre in US history.  It began during morning services the first Sunday in April when everyone attending was killed and continues through the use of Sunday services and funerals where visitors are killed upon entry. 

Additional victims of the massacre come from the apparent coverup, they are the people who report other victims as missing who have been previously killed. They are identified, located and murdered after filing a missing persons report, or in some cases simply mentioning another victim’s name. 

More than 125 men, women and children were killed that Sunday, and over [1,000 lives](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/Soundtrack-of-the-%23GreatStorm#nature-of-our-kind) in total have been killed. 

## "Where The Distance Makes The Difference"

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, KY.  The church is in a remote area of Lexington with very low traffic and very few, if any, routine police patrols.

The church’s motto is: _Where the distance makes the difference._

The city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. The church’s address conveys city, however, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a rural suburb called Pricetown. (See [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZgjiHDMm8bGsM2e7?g_st=ic))

![IMG_0430](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/assets/140252803/92105bb7-0bf3-457f-a14e-076162840973)

## The First Sunday

The massacre started on Sunday April 2, 2023 when men and women of the CIA, led by Annie Jacobsen, executed an attack based on tactics written by Jacobsen in her book, _"Surprise, Kill, Vanish."_  A review of the book can be found on the CIA's [website](https://www.cia.gov/static/Review-Surprise-Kill-Vanish.pdf), a copy is stored in our repository and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/blob/base/assets/pdf/20180830_cia_review_surprise_kill_vanish.pdf).  

The Creator says, “Much like _’Able Danger’_ was the blueprint for 9/11.  _’Surprise, Kill, Vanish’_ was the blueprint used by the CIA for the initial attach Mount Calvary Baptist Church on the first Sunday.”

![IMG_0330](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/assets/140252803/348262e4-5f2d-4055-8157-9d12285435e4)


According to the Creator, Annie Jacobsen along with "Michael Blackmon" attended morning services and shortly before the end of the morning session, Jacobsen sent a message to a team waiting outside to start the attack.

![IMG_0329](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/assets/140252803/24fa38cf-4768-4b60-8533-b7785c9b1d3f)

## Anatomy of the Attack

CIA personnel quietly entered the church through the exterior doors in the back of the church and blocked the exits.  The doors between the rest areas and the sanctuary are always closed during services to prevent disruptions. At the same time approximately fifty men and a handful of women gathered in the vestibule and on the front steps of the church undetected by the congregation. 

![Floorplan of Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/blob/master/assets/floorplan.png)

A loud announcement was heard in the sanctuary coming from outside and a projection was then played on every window in the sanctuary. Through the stained glass, the projection made it appear as though dozens of men were gathering in a formation outside of each window and the church was surrounded. 

The already startled congregation then heard Annie Jacobsen’s voice, instructing everyone to remain seated and that they were conducting a law enforcement action.  A loud noise then caused most of the congregation to jump to their feet and turn towards the vestibule where they seen the entering personnel dressed in all black uniforms. 

The entering force hurled racial slurs and commands that made the congregation realize that their entrance was not any legal or police action. Although Micah has learned that some of the individuals that entered the church that Sunday were actual law enforcement, some from Riverdale Police Department in Georgia. (Listen to [#theconfessionpartone](https://m.soundcloud.com/SotCMission23) on SoundCloud—Warning: Language.)

Several in the congregation attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered by the individuals on mobile phones, not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government or any other public safety answering point (PSAP).

At least one truck full of cellular telephony equipment, called a COW (Cell On Wheels), was parked near the church prior to the assault.

COWs are deployed and used by mobile network operators to quickly restore service in the event of a catastrophic tower failure. Once deployed and powered up, mobile phones in the area will treat it like any other tower they encounter. Quite simply, if the phone “hears” the tower, it will talk to it. The typical tower covers roughly three miles, so when the COW was started mobile phones in the general vicinity treated it like any other tower they would hear along in a typical commute. 

The COWs were not connected to the available cellular networks that provide the coverage to the church. Micah, who has spent most of his professional career as an Internet Protocol Engineer with companies like textPlus and 373K specializes in Voice over IP and has worked alongside cellular providers like TMobile, made an professional guess as to what happened to the calls. “With the phones homed (connected) to the COW, any dialed number would be handled by the COWs onboard radio equipment. What would normally route over the back haul connection or the connection to the cellular networks, they could just hand off to equipment in the truck. You can download software from the web and, for me, it would take less than an hour to configure a soft switch to handle calls made to anything. Spending no money on a terminating carrier just playing a recording is simple, and routing those calls to another number once in the switch would take a couple bucks, a high speed Internet connection and about two more minutes of configuration.”  

The Creator says, they did just that for 911 and sent the calls to mobile phones. All other calls just failed with no recording. All SMS and Internet traffic was dropped or blocked. 

The Creator tells Micah that they used [Asterisk](https://asterisk.org), the most popular open source soft switch, and [Flowroute](https://flowroute.com) for terminating (completing) calls. Micah says, “All they needed was a credit card, they didn’t even need to make a phone call to get that setup. Flowroute would have never known what was going on, it’s just calls to a non-emergency number. From Flowroute’s vantage point, the leg of the call they’re handling, no one has called 911. They wouldn’t seen that. Just a call to a mobile phone number.”

The Creator has shown Micah the actual vehicle that served as the COW, parked on the very property where he lives at Legacy at Riverdale. 

The call takers were told for the operation to act as true 911 call takers, act as if they were gathering information, say they were sending help, but otherwise ignore the pleas for it.  

911 callers from within the sanctuary provided address information, a description of the activity inside the church and call back numbers. They were told emergency services were en-route and hung up on—-something never done by actual 911 call takers. 

Members of the congregation, in a two by two manner, were taken to the front of the church and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 

The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which is at the front of the church. The baptismal’s water had a formulation added to it which made it chemically cremate the bodies. 

### “Frying Chicken”

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA and others as “Frying Chicken.” 

The moniker was applied to the operation after the fact because the congregants did fight for their lives. 

### Securing Micah

Micah, whose government name is Kelvin Williams, was arrested for shoplifting in Riverdale, GA after shopping at the Texaco in the early morning hours of April 2nd, 2023. He was stopped while walking home. Charges for shoplifting were never filed. 

Micah says, “I am the righteous hand of God, and the devil you overlooked.” Meaning he simply does what he’s told to do by the Creator. Micah does not ever want anyone to think he is God, the Creator, or wants worship. “This works best when people don’t see me coming,” he says. 

He was booked into Clayton County jail, in a scene that he calls, “unique.” There were practically no other detainees to be seen in booking for a county that is rather large, has a huge police presence, and holds the world’s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL).

During booking, described by Micah as a well choreographed event, he encountered the CIA’s typical harassment jokes, torment through artwork of murdered friends and family and comments, a TomTom lookalike. He received a “TB skin test” unlike any he’d ever had before that caused a small bleed. The material that escaped was so weird he tried to keep it with his property on a gauze pad sealed in a tied rubber glove for review outside of the jail. The jail refused to let him place it in an about to be sealed property bag, which wouldn’t be opened again except by him upon release.

Finally, a strip search tailor-made for him. No body cavity search performed, just a front and center visual inspection by at least three CIA employees, one posing as a guard, the other two posing as inmate trustees. 

After booking Micah walked with another CIA employee posing as an inmate unescorted through the entire length of a long service corridor to an housing unit at the far end. Once there, he was shown to an already overcrowded two-man cell, told to sleep on the floor, between the toilet and the bottom bunk. His body was partially exposed but head and torso under the lower bunk. 

Micah spent the night in a cell, with constant visitors, with gnats and similar sized flying and crawling insects, a chemical smell he couldn’t identify or find the source of. The Creator confirmed for Micah, the arrest was just an elaborate series of hits. Micah says, they had an art installation under the bed, but could never really understand what it was depicting. 

Shortly before noon, Micah estimates, he was rushed out of Clayton County, encountering not a single true inmate through the entire process and handed over to a waiting DeKalb County Sheriff’s Deputy. After being placed in his SUV, Micah started the long ride to DeKalb County Detention Center. 

While the Deputy appeared to verify the warrant, Micah began enduring a sustained attack from either cloaked individuals, whom he could not see or from outside and/or above the vehicle. Micah seen and felt numerous lasers. The lasers are not for pointing, but killing. Micah has experienced them before beginning in the Des Moines airport, where he was hit in the heart by what appeared to be a passing traveler. 

![IMG_0228](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/bc3e2ba6-6187-433f-9496-3ff58153cdfe)

After arriving at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Micah asked the Deputy if he could use his mobile phone while still seated in the car.  He sent out a tweet and contacted Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation, one of the program managers who had assisted him while homeless with obtaining his free hotel room at the Motel 6 in Decatur and his rent-free for a year apartment at Legacy at Riverdale, to let her know that he was arrested and his dog was locked in his apartment.

According to the Creator, shortly after Micah was inside the detention center, Micah's program manager, Tracy, notified Jacobsen that Micah was in custody and secure.  That is when Jacobsen launched the attack, by sending a message using TextNow to the personnel waiting outside. 

## The Ongoing Massacre 

The church was partially rehabbed and videos were produced to portray a sense of normalcy. Visitors to the church anytime the church has been opened since have been murdered. 

[[https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/blob/master/assets/mcbc_front.jpg|alt=MCBC]]

This screen capture obtained from the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church Facebook page (see warnings above) clearly shows the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and the impersonated Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III wearing no pastoral robe and tennis shoes during a Sunday morning worship session. Micah says, “I spent so much of my youth in this sanctuary, I know that’s my church. The two-way mirrored glass above the lectern tells me it’s my church. That is actually a window in Felix’s office that lets him see if he needs to hurry up or if he has more time to counsel anyone in his office on Sunday mornings.”

![IMG_0116](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/be070c92-e082-4714-8148-7c9bbaa50656)

Missing in this photo is our piano (on the left) and our organ (on the right, the organ in the choir stand is much smaller and is located in other places in later videos), they have been removed and pews from the back wall of the church put in their place. Also the choir, the choir stands have been wrecked and mostly empty--men randomly hang out there in the videos the charade church is producing now. The altar and lectern are new, made from a much lower quality wood, the altar was sized to fit between the two out of place pews. Mount Calvary Baptist Church would have never advertised its web address on the lectern. 

The replacement altar inscription is missing two words: “DO THIS” [IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME].

## The "Church" Today

The church’s building and interior are seen in all of the videos produced and distributed on Facebook under the name “Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church.” In some correspondence the name, “Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.” is used. The exterior and interior is without a doubt Mount Calvary Baptist Church as evidenced by exterior photos on Google Maps, and a very unique small mirrored glass window directly above the lectern. That window is located in the pastor’s office. 

The blood spilled on the first day of the massacre was cleaned for the most part and the church made presentable enough for video production. The videos do not show most of the sanctuary, which is believed to still have blood stains. 

Actors were hired to aide in the production of video and convey a since of normalcy at the church.  The videos and sermons, which are distributed on Facebook (see warning below), clearly show the actors are atheist and have no experience with Christian worship.

### "Grilling Chicken"

The massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church continues, and is referred to by the CIA as “Grilling Chicken.” It was given this moniker due to the fact that people are murdered as they arrive to services at the church, which is far more subdued than the first Sunday since victims arrive and are killed in much smaller groups.

In addition to Sunday services, the CIA has holds mock funerals at the church for victims and persons contacting the church looking for them are given a funeral date and time. The SotC have learned from the Creator persons filing missing persons reports are located and killed off church property if they do not come to a funeral. 

## Political Actors

The CIA added the “Missionary” because of the missions that Micah has told them he and TomTom “run” for the Creator. 

The CIA must erase the family of Micah and Micah himself. As Micah is one person who has stated clearly he would allow anyone (including a foreign country) who have similar losses in a geographic area (ie. everyone disappearing within a day) to investigate the loss of his family in Sandy Hook, TN. 

A simple investigation would show a method of genocide that is so quick, effective and undetectable that people that are being killed have no idea it’s happening. Micah’s family were all on a Zoom videoconference on new cell phones with new SIM cards, which they received in the mail. An unidentified employee of the CIA, which secretly owns Zoom, was making screen capture images. They were so busy looking at a manufactured cloud, they never noticed the plane or fine powder it dropped on them. Micah’s family had been irradiated from above, they were all dead within a day. 

The NSA and FBI are active in covering up the CIA’s actions and preventing Micah from getting the word out. 

The NSA abuses its technical powers to eavesdrop on Micah and Thomas. They provide technical support to the CIA in numerous ways, including the COWs to divert calls to 911 and the personnel (often contractors who don’t know who they’re working for) to answer them. The NSA uses some of the Facebook and Social Media accounts of Micah’s friends to further torment him. 

After describing the baptismal at Mount Calvary as a small pool to someone in his apartment, Micah encountered this post as the first thing he seen on Facebook the next day. 

![IMG_0210](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/50d14430-ff55-4fc0-ad1c-b51ad13e37b1)

Stuart Bruner and commenter, Scott Hager, are hometown friends of Micah’s and currently "missing" and impersonated. Neither have ever been to his apartments or homes outside of Jessamine County. 

The FBI uses their “top law enforcement agency in the land” to obtain, disclose to the CIA, who then make disappear anyone who reports a victim missing. 

According to the Creator, the President is aware of the ongoing massacre and is thinking of his political career instead of his citizens. He’s briefed daily by the CIA on the matter. He’s aware the FBI and NSA have devoted personnel to covering up the entire matter. President Biden has authorized the use of military force in the US against Micah and surrounding US citizens. 

## Corporate Actors

Gilead Sciences started the larger tragedy in response to a viral load test result which showed no HIV in a patient, Kenneth Mabry, which was known to be HIV positive and had years of documented viral load tests results. 

The Creator says, “Gilead Sciences CEO and CFO both personally knew of the plans to attack Mount Calvary Baptist Church and did not object to them.”

Gilead Sciences may not have known about the long term plans for Mount Calvary, but according to the Creator, “they are invoiced by a company which they know is none other than the CIA for each person killed at the church—even if no name is provided as in the case for children and those not carrying identification, and are current with their payments.”

Gilead Sciences has not disclosed the massacre, the larger tragedy, the competitive threat or market risk to their shareholders or any regulatory body. 

## The Charade Continues 

The CIA has learned, from eavesdropping and in-person surveillance of his apartment that their charade is very easy to recognize by anyone who’s ever attended church regularly. In an effort to improve it, they have had their actors studying footage of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

Anyone attempting to find images from Mount Calvary pre-massacre will find it next to impossible. The only image Micah has found is from the CIA/NSA response to his first letter. It is the letterhead. 

![IMG_0122](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/edf1b789-6ba3-405a-b1c6-aa15dfd3b7eb)

The church has began using the choir stands and purchased a piano, but has no pianist. As of August 2023, there are new videos timestamped 2017-2019 that were not on the Facebook page a couple of weeks ago. However, the videos still show the damaged choir stands, missing organ, displaying large signs in the choir stands with Mount abbreviated “Mt” and the choir is sitting on folding chairs. 

They also realized they had to do something to counter the actions taken by Micah in his initial letter since Rev. Felix G Williamas, III  never submitted to the requested oral swab for DNA testing to prove his identity. 

After hearing Micah say, “To become a member of Mount Calvary one has to get in their ass in the baptismal, there’s no other way.” The CIA removed the chemical cremation from the baptismal, installed a first of its kind baptismal seat, and begin baptizing new members. 

![Baptism](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/8b4dfbb7-c01d-457c-a980-ec92bb9720ba)

Upon seeing this photograph on their Facebook page, Micah almost lost his mind. “Did they even read about the Baptism of Jesus?” He asked. 

It took him a while to realize how they could get it so wrong and then he figured it out. Sermons, weddings, funerals and even communion services have been videotaped in the past. But at Mount Calvary, Micah says, “Everything about baptisms is old fashioned, there’s no instrumentation just one old negro spiritual is sung. I doubt anyone ever videotaped one. Further, if pictures are taken, they’d be taken from the front, not the service entrance (entry/exit on the side) to the baptismal.” (Micah intentionally withholding the name of the spiritual.)

Micah adds about the baptisms of late, “The family pictured on Facebook looks eerily like my uncle, aunt, and their grandchildren. All of which did not go to church and they are all missing today.” He adds, “Yes, I said it’s a family operation… But not all of the family participated.” 

Micah addresses the family in  Micah's [Open Letter to the CIA regarding the Pastoral Anniversary event](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/Pastoral-Anniversary).

## Continuing the Massacre
### Sunday Services

According to the Creator, Mount Calvary Baptist Church is attended by CIA employees and contractors on Sundays who capture and kill anyone who enters the church.  

The videos produced for Facebook are made on other days of the week and published on Sundays.  The SotC warn (see below) against viewing the videos or going to the Facebook page of "Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church" and cautions anyone who views the timestamps as true, the CIA modifies the timestamps of the posts to show activity on days and years different from the actual time taken or posted.

### Funerals

The SotC have learned that at least ten funerals were held at Mount Calvary Baptist Church but they were held to kill any person who came to pay their respects.  The funerals are not announced in the obituaries and are not for any one person.

Anyone who calls the church inquiring about a missing loved one is told of their funeral.  The funeral date is given and when the mourner arrives at the church they are killed.  This is being done to silence anyone with a missing friend or loved one.  The SotC advise everyone to not call the church, and only attend a funeral after verifying the death and funeral plans with a minimum of:
- verify the death with the hospital or county coroner;
- a reputable funeral home (make sure the person you’re talking to has been there at least two years, ask for a church reference);
- an obituary that is PRINTED in the Lexington-Herald Leader or your local newspaper. Do not accept any online obituary (ie. legacy.com or a funeral home);
- verify the cemetery where the decedent is to be interred. 

If you can verify a death and have verified the arrangements, if you choose to go to the funeral notify others where you are going and send them a link to this page. Advise your contacts that if you do not return to NOT file a missing persons report or contact the police as their lives may be in danger if they do so. 

The SotC, specifically Micah states, “Mount Calvary has its last sermon and it’s last hymn was sung, I’m sure it will hear lots of prayers in the years to come but no one should expect anything but an attempt to attract friends and loved ones from those who are illegally occupying our church and preying on unsuspecting churchgoers or services attendees.”

### 40th Pastoral Anniversary

The CIA conducted an effort to eliminate any remaining associates of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and used this Pastoral Anniversary celebration to attract those who have not yet been killed.  Micah viewed the photographs posted on Facebook and wrote an [open letter](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/Pastoral-Anniversary) (warning: language) to the CIA after noticing the choir and the award presenters.  Actresses who looked like Micah's mother, niece and sister were photographed in well placed positions in the choir stand, and the actresses bearing a resemblance to his mother and sister were photographed presenting awards.  Micah was informed by the Creator that his mother and sister, along with her children, his three nieces, were murdered by the CIA in October of 2023.

Micah has said several times that the church was a "family operation" and believes the CIA used this "Pastoral Anniversary" as a way to validate the charade and it's impersonators.  Micah's mother and sister had been living in Alabama, active members of a very large church.  The church's name is being withheld intentionally.

In February, Micah posted on Facebook that no one should meet with him under any circumstances until they spoke with him by phone and verified his identity. Micah stands by this, the Creator also does agree, no one should meet with Micah until they verify it is him over the phone by asking questions only personal things that only he would know the answer to, never anything posted online, video calls are highly recommended. 

![IMG_0357](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/assets/140252803/436a317b-dc4a-4ac3-9ea3-c648d8708114)

Micah couldn't help but to notice the pastor at the lectern, that actor bear a strong resemblance to a much heavier Micah,                                       the one most people in central Kentucky would remember.

The Creator advises the photoshoot was held on Saturday August 19, 2023 before the announced event.  Regardless of the SotC's efforts to warn the publc, about 50 people were killed at the church on Sunday August 20, 2023.  The CIA's cycle continues as they located and killed all of those who filed missing persons reports for victims killed at the church who visited for the Pastoral Anniversary.

Micah expressed concerns for the impersonators resembling himself and family, the CIA according to the Creator has killed every one they've ever hired.

Read: Micah's [Open Letter to the CIA regarding the Pastoral Anniversary event](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/Pastoral-Anniversary).

### Emmanuel Baptist Church
![IMG_0120](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/25a652c1-87b0-45c9-b19c-cb806f07e4f4)

The address for the church shown at the top of this flyer is 4742 Todds Road.  The CIA which has no respect for the significance of Mount Calvary to Christians routinely abbreviates the "Mount" in Mount Calvary.  It also uses 4743 Todds Road for Mount Calvary, which is reported by Apple and Google Maps as the Mount Calvary Baptist Church Cemetery across the street.  Additionally, the flyer shows "Todd's" (note the apostrophe) Road, a common auto correction but something true members of Mount Calvary Baptist Church never allow to happen.  

The Creator hears every prayer.  Regardless of the name the person praying is praying to, because all prayer lines go straight to the Creator.  The Creator does not share your prayers with His servants unless you specifically pray for Him to do so, or He knows it was your actual intent to get one of us a message.

The Creator will provide to His servants information necessary to do their tasks for Him, including what Micah calls "aggregate prayer information."

When looking into the 40th Anniversary Micah asked the Creator, "Have you **ever** received a legitimate prayer from the pastor or a member of Emmanuel Baptist Church which has a reported address of 3815 West Broadway in Louisville, KY?"

The Creator responded: No.  

Micah furthers, “Most Christians spell it Immanuel.”

## Motive

While the operation's name is based on a [racist stereotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_chicken_stereotype) (Wikipedia) and racial slurs were used during the massacre Micah does not believe, and the Creator has confirmed, it was not racially motivated.  The massacre at Mount Calvary was continuing a cover up of the CIA’s misdeeds in Sandy Hook, TN.  In order to never have those misdeeds known, the CIA has to completely erase Micah’s family and anyone who may know them.    

Micah’s mother, Patricia Ann Crawley Williams, was a longtime member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and very active there. For a long time she was on the usher board and read the church announcements, putting her in front of thousands of worshipers over the years both from Mount Calvary and visiting congregations. 

Micah himself has had all of his identity documents stolen from his apartment twice.  Previously the CIA made it impossible to obtain his birth certificate.  His bank accounts have been commandeered by CIA personnel posing as friends.

His family has been practically erased.  The family's very large farm in Sandy Hook has been illegally sold and the once unincorporated city is now considered a neighborhood of neighboring Mount Pleasant.  The families cemetery was dug up, gravestones and caskets pulverized.  A church, Orr Chapel, on the family's land was destroyed and all of it's members were located and killed.  Micah does not know of any family members who attended the church, it predated the families purchase of the farm (over 125 years ago).  The church at one time served as a one-room school house, which his mother and siblings attended.  The one room school provided a primary education for that generation, afterwards they went on public high schools. 

## Taking Back The Church

When Micah (born: Kelvin Eugene Williams), a lifelong member of the Mount Calvary Baptist Church, learned of the massacre he immediately wrote a letter to his pastor the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.  The correspondence and actions of the CIA before and after the initial letter clearly indicate that they in fact did conduct the massacre.

To write the first letter Micah visited a public library in Riverdale, GA on May 5th, 2023.  While using a public computer, Micah had numerous attempts on his life, his letter was modified before his eyes by someone (he believes the NSA) using an administrator's session of VMWare Horizons (a PCOIP platform).  At 14:30 EDT He left the library at the Creator's instruction as military aircraft were approaching.  It is the policy of the Creator that the SotC never flee danger, however He instructed Micah to do so due to the number of lives that could have been lost in the library and the apartment complex behind it.  The letter was completed the following day at Atlanta's Central Library while Micah was surrounded by CIA personnel and additional attempts to take his life were made.

The purpose of the first letter was to take control of the church, name a interim pastor to invite law enforcement in the Commonwealth of Kentucky into the church to investigate the massacre, additionally Micah wanted to ensure that no other persons visiting Mount Calvary Baptist Church would be harmed since it was apparent to him and the Creator advised him that it was still being used to capture and kill any members who were not present on the first Sunday.

Micah has stated since the first letter was written, that upon receiving a DNA test he would immediately step down as pastor and reinstall Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, essentially installing himself as pastor was purely temporary.  Now that it is evident the massacre occurred, once he has removed all of CIA and government actors and activities from church grounds, he plans to rescind the letter making it null and void.  While an ordained minister, Micah never wanted to pastor a church, and only installed himself for Constitutional reasons and he was the only member of the church the Creator wanted identified.

## Warning 

The Servants of the Creator (SotC) recommend that no one visit the church or church property until we announce that we have taken control of it. Furthermore, we recommend individuals do not view anything from the church on Facebook as views may be tracked and reported to the CIA.

When the SotC have taken control of the church, an announcement will be here on this article.  Before the SotC take control of the church, you will have heard this on the evening broadcast news around the world, and there will have been earthquakes from the [ringing of the bell.](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell)

The Creator says that if your loved one was last known to be heading to church service at Mount Calvary Baptist Church or Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church and they didn't return, that you should NOT file a missing persons report until this has been reported widely (seen on every evening news broadcast).  He furthers stating that law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have provided the names of those reporting missing persons to the CIA, and the CIA has murdered the person making the report. 
 
If any member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church reads this, DO NOT GO TO THE CHURCH. DO NOT CALL THE CHURCH. Everyone, including the Creator, agrees the best thing to do is to deny any relationship with, or knowledge of the church to anyone that asks. Micah says, "If you know the church, you know who's parked where, you know you can see that from afar.  YOU KNOW, he's always there early.  DO NOT GO ONTO CHURCH PROPERTY IF YOU DO NOT SEE HIM PARKED IN HIS SPOT.  Don't accept a new car, don't fall for it (they do read this too), I'll post here when he has given me the DNA test (it's oh so simple--my mom did it long ago!) that I asked of him to prove his identity.  It ain't Felix."

Once the SotC announce they have taken control of the property it will be safe to visit. Sadly, the church has seen its last worship session.

## Frequently Asked Questions 
* How is there a first-hand account of events?
     - The human race can only thank the Creator for that. He can take form of any conscious entity and does from time to time. On April 2nd, 2023 He was a black woman who went to church at Mount Calvary Baptist Church. He knew they had no intent of leaving anyone alive, so He went to witness everything so He could place the SotC there even though they weren’t. Micah says, “This is how I’ve been able to write the article, that and His input. We both have to go through the remainder when we are together. I’ve witnessed up to the point they entered the sanctuary, it was the most terrifying thing ever, and I was in my church, the last place I ever thought I’d be scared like that, I just knew I had to get out somehow but there was no way. It’s the worst two minutes of my life. He tells me it gets worse and went on for six hours. (s)He was one of the last to be killed.”
     - The Creator cannot be killed, He has stepped in for both Micah and TomTom several times each when they were going to endure an exceptionally brutal death at the hands of the CIA. They merely wake up from a sleep somewhere else on Earth. 
     - The Creator does not ever allow His SotC to not complete a mission. 
* How did they project men outside the windows of the church?
     - Micah sees this daily at his apartment at Legacy at Riverdale.

_**Editor’s Notes:** The narrative you have read is true. If you do not believe it, you need to pray to ask if it’s true if you still don’t believe it, call the Kentucky State Police and asked them  the average number of people who typically go missing a month in Kentucky and then ask him how many African-Americans went missing Sunday, April 2, 2023 from the Lexington area._

_The City of Lexington and Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government should not be blamed or called.  They did not know about the first day of the massacre, their PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point / 911 Call Center) never received a call, all calls were diverted using temporary cell towers.  When Micah wrote his letter to the church, he copied law enforcement and the media.  The CIA wasted no time and were faster than e-mail, they told recipients that he was crazy and suffering from delusions, etc to make the letter really seem like the product of someone having a paranoid fantasy.  Please don't call them._

If you want to contact Micah you must use Wire. [Click here for his profile and info on how to download Wire.](https://account.wire.com/user-profile/?id=1CFBE1AC-E293-40D5-A38F-1E165D3DE50D) 

The Creator forbids the use of any other secret messaging apps. Micah says, "If you request the SotC to use Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp for their respective encryption, we will simply recommend using your phone's native SMS app, or just having coffee in an NSA break room with the NSA staffer at the table with us--in the end, its all the same."

* Gilead Sciences started the larger tragedy after learning of a cure of HIV.  The patient, was a friend of Micah's who received a formula designed Creator.  Micah was gathering proof cases.  During a routine viral load test, Ken Mabry's test came back "Target Not Found."  He was interrogated intensely, and told them "my friend gave me something."
* Gilead Sciences paid $300,000 to a front company of the CIA to eliminate the problem--Ken and Micah (then Kelvin).
* Gilead Sciences was joined by other major players in the pharmaceutical industry when they learned of the cure, as it meant the end of disease in human beings.
* The Gilead Sciences led consortium to "cure the cure" has funded the entire tragedy and has paid for each and every life taken within the tragedy and at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.
* Micah has begged Gilead Sciences to hit him with a Cease & Desist numerous times publicly, so he could willingly violate it to be pulled into a courtroom.  Gilead refuses to do so.  The tweet below was showing them how another business, one which they are a partner in, had found a lawyer capable of sending one.  They still haven't sent a Cease & Desist.

* Incomplete whitewashing/scrubbing of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  
* There are inconsistencies with what Apple, Google, MapQuest, etc consider Mount Calvary's address vs the "Mt. Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc's" as shown on Facebook.

* The person posting this is not Stuart Bruner.  Stuart was a high school classmate of Kelvin / Micah's.  This is only to provide context into the "smallest pool" post of "Stuart's".  Micah was discussing how anyone in the Jessamine County High School 1993 could be verified as an actual student or resident of Jessamine County by asking them questions, which were:
    - "Who was your ride partner on Kick Bootie?"  
    - "What were the things the announcer said year after year?"
    - "What was the song that he always played?"
* Stuart would have never called the event the "Jessamine County Fair" as Kick Bootie was only in town every year for the "Jamboree," a lifelong resident of Jessamine County, we only know it as the "Jessamine Jamboree" or "Jamboree."  If they were to change the name a thousand times, true folks from Jessamine County only call it the "Jessamine Jamboree."
* The photo is not of the Jessamine Jamboree either, in fact the photo came from nowhere in Jessamine County.  The Jamboree was held in the parking lot of K-Mart, then Kroger.  We've never had a Food Depot in Jessamine County.

* Danny is not Micah, although recently he’s adopted the current Micah look and persona. 
* The Creator says that “‘Danny’ has the Kelvin Eugene Williams, Georgia driver’s license and has done numerous things with it to get Micah arrested. ‘Danny’ is CIA.”
* ‘Danny’ tells others he’s a roommate, he’s been told to leave numerous times. 
* ‘Danny’ told Micah he did not move in, and lived at least one other apartment at Legacy with “Chivy.” “Chivy” is a name that Annie Jacobsen uses around Legacy and when she met with Micah as a buddy/friend of “Antonio Banks.”
* “Danny” uses several different tactics to handle Micah daily, including:
     - Manipulating Micah’s subconscious;
     - Using Micah’s subconscious to cause physical changes to Micah’s body;
     - Using Micah’s subconscious to cause emotional damage to Micah;
     - Using Micah’s subconscious to obtain information from Micah, even while sleeping;
     - Controlling/limiting Micah’s interactions with others;
     - Controlling the flow of money to Micah, as his only source of money, his lodging fees—-currently over $300 owed but will not stop showing up or breaking in;
     - Controlling the flow of foods and other consumables, including illicit drugs;
     - Illegally spying or tapping his technical resources (locking phones, infecting phones and computers);
     - Creates, installs or delivers macabre artwork or threats against other CIA victims known to Micah;
     - Delivers personal effects of little or no value to Micah’s residence;
     - He does cook. Micah never eats it, because what won’t kill a human, is human. f92c5c3
     - Stealing items and swapping devices;
     - Studying and mimicking Micah;
     - Physical harm including murder.
