A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

While He does not require worship or prayer, nor does He endorse or prefer any religion, the Creator is the only one who hears and responds to them. The Creator would like anyone who does not believe anything herein to pray. 

For the foreseeable future, We know there will be a lot of things said that distort the truth. The Creator suggests you simply pray anytime you consume anything about Mount Calvary Baptist Church, or any other church massacred by the CIA. 

We use the hashtag [#PrayToVerify](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/%23PrayToVerify) a lot, that’s because some things are very hard to believe. But no one can make you feel any kind of way, He can and will when you ask Him to. 

* You are: 
     - Reading about a church that is located on Todds Road in Lexington, KY; or 
      - Reading anything about a church with “Mount Calvary” in its name in Lexington, KY; or 
      - you are going to a wedding or funeral somewhere on Todds Road in Lexington, KY. 

* You pray: 
      - “Heavenly Father, will you help and guide me.” 

* How you may feel: 
     - You suddenly hate everything about the website you’re on and you have the overwhelming desire to go to github.com, then search for “Mount Calvary” EVEN THOUGH you’ve never been on that site and the front page says it’s about everything except churches. 
     - You suddenly feel like, “I need to mow the yard and I really don’t wanna see them like that.”

* What should you do: 
     - **Don’t fight the feeling.**
     - Do exactly what you feel. 

* Remember: 
     - No one on Earth can make you feel anything. No one.

# The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church
![IMG_0117](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/5b61181a-de0c-4cf3-be46-9bb34b398e55)

A small church on Todds Road in remote Lexington, Kentucky is the site of the largest massacre inside of a church in US history.

It began during morning services the first Sunday in April 2023 when everyone in attendance was killed. Approximately 125 people died that Sunday. The massacre’s coverup has started a genocide referred to as the [Bluegrass Genocide](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Bluegrass-Genocide) by the SotC. The massacre was one event in a larger tragedy that has affected every country on Earth and almost every human being on Earth.  

The death toll from the subsequent genocide, which is ongoing, comes from families and friends of the initial victims of the massacre that attended funerals held at the church. People calling the church looking for loved ones are provided funeral arrangements on a return call. The funeral is 

The church is the first logical place any rational person would call, likely before the police. It’s a church and the last place their loved one said they were going before they vanished.

The time and date provided for a funeral, was never for one particular victim, the funeral’s date and time is determined by the “work” schedule—when the CIA would have the staff on-hand to commit the murders. So, a victim may have had as many as ten funerals reported to callers. As each wave of funerals passed, the death toll drastically increased.

Additional deaths have occurred after individuals made reports of missing friends and family members.

More than 125 men, women and children were killed that first Sunday, and over 1,000 lives in total have been lost.

The cover-up operation launch for the CIA has created the nation’s  first genocide of a non-indigenous people, and the first genocide in the world targeting Christians. The death toll is comprised of African-American, Caucasian, Latino and Asian victims. See: [The Bluegrass Genocide](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Bluegrass-Genocide)

## Location

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is located at 4742 Todds Rd. in Lexington, KY.  The church is in a remote area of Lexington with very low traffic and very few, if any, routine police patrols.

The city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. The church’s address conveys city, however, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a rural suburb called Pricetown.

## Anatomy of Attack

Around 1:30am on the morning of the attack, Micah was arrested in Riverdale, Georgia for shoplifting. 

The alleged incident occurred at the Texaco, and while walking back to his apartment, Micah walked past a police officer driving slowly on GA-85. 

As Micah turned onto Howard St, the officer pulled up behind him and turned on the lights. Micah was questioned, arrested and taken to Clayton County Jail. Micah had multiple attempts made on his life inside the jail. 

The next morning he was rushed out of the jail into a waiting DeKalb County Sheriff’s patrol car. Micah never encountered a single inmate from the surrounding community or general public throughout the process, only CIA personnel posing as inmates or jail employees. 

Upon arrival at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Micah asked to use his mobile phone. Micah was concerned about a dog he had, that was locked in a pet carrier in his apartment. Micah contacted Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation and asked her if she could help him by caring for the dog while he was incarcerated. Tracy urged him to re-home the dog instead of a temporary shelter, Micah agreed. 

Micah sent out a tweet hoping someone would see it, and entered the DeKalb County Detention Center and another round of attempts on his life.

According to the Creator, Annie Jacobsen 
arrived at Mount Calvary Baptist Church around 11:45 am. Jacobsen was welcomed in by the ushers and found a seat in the rear of the church. Jacobsen focused mainly on her mobile phone. 

After Thompson received the call from Micah, according to the Creator, she sent a message to Jacobsen advising that Micah was now secured at DeKalb County Detention Center. 

Jacobsen sent a message to the supervisor of the group outside. The group made up of approximately fifty men and one woman were dressed in all black. 

Four men armed with shotguns quietly entered the church through the exterior door of the anteroom outside of the women’s restroom on the northwest corner of the church, two of the men went into the adjoining men’s anteroom. 

The rear entrances are the lesser used entrances with the women’s anteroom being the one generally used due to the layout of the parking lot. During services, the doors between the anterooms to the sanctuary are closed to prevent interruptions from other activities in the rear of the church. 

Simultaneously, the group that was waiting outside came from the rear parking lot of the church and gathered outside on the front steps of the church, largely undetected by the congregation. 

![Floorplan of Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/blob/master/assets/floorplan.png)

Jacobsen got up from her seat in the sanctuary and went outside and met up with the team gathering in front of the church. 

Within the sanctuary, congregants noticed  men amassing outside the windows on the western side of the church that runs along Pricetown Lane and in front of the church through opened windows. It gave the congregants that seen it the sense that the church was being surrounded, unnerving some.  

Most of the congregation jumped to its feet when they heard the noise from the group gathering in the vestibule. They were alarmed by the number of people in the small room that normally has no more than five or so waiting at any given time. Also by the fact that by that point, late in the service, usually no one is trying to enter the sanctuary. 

Jacobsen had obtained a bullhorn outside and announced that she absolutely hated the service and that everyone in the church needed to die. 

At that point, the individuals who were in the anterooms in the back of the church, opened the doors to the sanctuary with their shotguns at the ready, and the group that had amassed in the vestibule loudly entered the sanctuary. They hurled racial slurs that made the congregation realize that their entrance was not any law enforcement action. 

Although not a law enforcement action, Micah has learned that some in the group were law enforcement, a few of them were at the scene when Micah was arrested earlier that morning. 

Several in the congregation attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered by the individuals on mobile phones, not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government or any other public safety answering point (PSAP).

At least one truck full of cellular telephony equipment, called a Cell On Wheels (or COW), was parked in the rear parking lot. It was powered on shortly after arrival.

COWs are deployed and used by mobile network operators to quickly restore service in the event of a catastrophic tower failure. Once deployed and powered up, mobile phones in the area will treat it like any other tower they encounter. Quite simply, if the phone “hears” the tower, it will talk to it. The typical tower covers roughly one-half miles, so when the COW was started mobile phones in the general vicinity treated it like any other tower they would hear along in a typical commute. 

The COWs were not connected to the available cellular networks that provide the coverage to the church. Micah, who has spent most of his professional career as an Internet Protocol Engineer with companies like textPlus and 373K specializes in Voice over IP and has worked alongside cellular providers like TMobile, made an professional guess as to what happened to the calls. 

Micah says, “With the phones homed (connected) to the COW, any dialed number would be handled by the COWs onboard radio equipment. What would normally route over the back haul connection or the connection to the cellular networks, they could just hand off to equipment in the truck. You can download software from the web and, for me, it would take less than an hour to configure a soft switch to handle calls made to anything. Spending no money on a terminating carrier just playing a recording is simple, and routing those calls to another number once in the switch would take a couple bucks, a high speed Internet connection and about two more minutes of configuration.”

According to the Creator, the configuration Micah describes is identical to what was deployed. All calls to 911 were routed and connected to their personnel’s mobile phones. All other calls were dropped. 

The Creator tells Micah that they used [Asterisk](https://asterisk.org), the most popular open source soft switch, and [Flowroute](https://flowroute.com) for terminating (completing) calls. Micah says, “All they needed was a credit card, they didn’t even need to make a phone call to get that setup. Flowroute would have never known what was going on, it’s just calls to a non-emergency number. From Flowroute’s vantage point, the leg of the call they’re handling, no one has called 911. Over a SIP trunk, they likely wouldn’t have seen that. Just a normal call to a mobile phone number.”

The call takers were told for the operation to act as true 911 call takers, act as if they were gathering information, say they were sending help, but otherwise ignore the pleas for it.  Two out of the seven call takers have worked in PSAPs as 911 call takers, and provided training to the others. 

911 callers from within the sanctuary provided address information, a description of the activity inside the church and call back numbers. They were told emergency services were en-route and hung up on—-something rarely done by actual 911 call takers. 

Inside the normally peaceful sanctuary became hell almost immediately as the CIA’s personnel became animals. They raped, pillaged and terrorized the congregation. Parents did everything to shield their children from the things going on around them. 

In the remote church, far from routine police visits and while following the orders of Annie Jacobsen the CIA’s personnel began killing. Members of the congregation were taken to the front of the church and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 

The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which is at the front of the church. The baptismal’s water had a formulation added to it which made it chemically cremate the bodies. 

### “Frying Chicken”

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA and others as “Frying Chicken.” 

The moniker was applied to the operation after the fact because the congregants did fight for their lives. 

## Aftermath
The CIA formed [[Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.|Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church Inc]] and began maintaining an occupation of the church’s property. 

They attempted a coverup of “Frying Chicken” but ended up spawning the [[The Bluegrass Genocide|]]. 

Servant of the Creator Micah has been working to remove the CIA and [[Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church Inc|Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church Inc]] from the church’s property. 

The Creator, nor His servants find the use of “Missionary” in the name comical given it that the massacre stems from the [[Creator’s Mission 23 for Life on Earth|]]. 

## Surprise, Kill, Vanish
The initial massacre was based on tactics written by Jacobsen in her book, _"Surprise, Kill, Vanish."_  A review of the book can be found on the CIA's [website](https://www.cia.gov/static/Review-Surprise-Kill-Vanish.pdf), a copy is stored in our repository and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/blob/base/assets/pdf/20180830_cia_review_surprise_kill_vanish.pdf).  

The Creator says, “Much like _’Able Danger’_ was the blueprint for 9/11.  _’Surprise, Kill, Vanish’_ was the blueprint used by the CIA for the initial attach Mount Calvary Baptist Church on the first Sunday.”

## Confirmation by the CIA

The CIA inadvertently confirmed the murder of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III on two occasions. 

The first confirmation came when a CIA Officer placed the ecclesiastical clergy ring of the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III beside him in a display of pride and winning at keeping him silenced. 

Micah put the ring in a safe place and the CIA has tried repeatedly to take it back. 

The ring was given to Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III upon his graduation from seminary and shows how he rarely removed it. 

![IMG_0002](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/assets/140292625/e1a5c148-a267-40e6-8e3f-668c4d6e89a0)

The second confirmation came when they held a photo shoot at the church that prominently featured models who appeared to look like the family members of Micah. Micah wrote about the [Pastoral Anniversary on medium.com](https://medium.com/@theServantsoftheCreator/40th-pastoral-anniversary-9ce004764732).
