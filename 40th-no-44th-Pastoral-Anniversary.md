This is not my mother. They killed Patricia Ann Crawley Williams (left front in choir) in October of last year. I was in Des Moines at my fake job with the CIA when they did it. Even making the artwork in my AirBNB at Flux Apartments, a safe house.

This is not her awarding the fake Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III an award. The amount of awards and certificates issued nowadays at Mount Calvary is astonishing.
