This is not me. It could pass for an older version of me when I was a lot heavier. Maybe if you looked at my pics on my compromised Facebook account and then found a lookalike this is who you’d hire. 

I may be an ordained minister, but I would not ever pastor a flock. They are a lot of responsibility. It’s not me, Im “frontline” you’ll hear, I have to keep everything moving.

But no, I’m in Riverdale as I posted this afternoon with an assassin/minder at my rent-free apartment at Legacy.

This is not my mother. They killed Patricia Ann Crawley Williams (left front in choir) in October of last year. I was in Des Moines at my fake job with the CIA when they did it. Even making the artwork in my AirBNB at Flux Apartments, a safe house.

This is not her awarding the fake Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III an award. The amount of awards and certificates issued nowadays at Mount Calvary is astonishing.

Anyone who knows my mother will instantly notice her much, much smaller breasts. 

Here is my real mother and niece, Kennedy, at Connors Steak and Seafood. This is the last known photo of the two.

This is not Kennedy between my “mom” and Katrina.

Here’s Karrington and a pregnant Katrina, also at Connor’s. Behind them of course, the CIA. “Brian,” Annie Jacobsen, and “Michael Blackmon.”

I do have to ask… Where is the model Karrington, Katrina’s middle daughter, or her infant? Dear CIA, Your model looks a big larger than her last photo in life at your fake restaurant Connor’s. 

I’m starting to think the CIA just chases and pushes bogus paper. Readers beware of Connor’s gift certificates, they are really an invite to your death. See this entry about [Connor’s Steak and Seafood](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/Connor’s-Steak-and-Seafood)

I am terribly worried about the lookalikes. The CIA has a bad habit of killing them. The last time I encountered a Katrina at the Walmart in Riverdale I pleaded with her to call her family. I showed her a photo of my sister. She was pulled into the back of the store and never left it. 

I waited almost until closing to escort her away. She never left the store. See old @ASOTC23 and @KelvinAtlanta tweets.

I tried. 

Can anyone identify these people at church? I thought I had stopped the Sunday service by adding the flyer for the bogus church out of Louisville. This wasn’t a church service anyway, just a photo shoot. 

Did you see how well positioned everything was? But the new piano is gone.

They’ve obviously removed a few rows of pews too.
