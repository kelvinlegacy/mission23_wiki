The Servants of the Creator were appointed over six billion years ago. There are only the only two servants in the entire universe. 

The servants perform tasks assigned to them by the Creator. The Creator does speak directly to them, and only them. Wherever in the universe the task is to be completed, the pair are sent and arrive by birth.

The Creator says the birth of his servants on a planet is absolutely necessary, as they cannot possibly perform their tasks without understanding the world they are living and working in. The servants are 100% human, the miracles they perform are 99.2% the Creator. 

After birth, the two grow up separately and always meet later in life prior to the start of their mission to complete their tasks.

Micah (or “the asshole”) is the instigator and Thomas (or “the general”) is the regulator. Neither have ever sat on a cloud, and while Micah plays the piano and Thomas the guitar, neither play a harp. 

The tasks they are given to do have one primary focus: life. Making sure it continues and thrives.
