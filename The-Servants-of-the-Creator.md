The Servants of the Creator were appointed over six billion years ago. There are only the only two servants of the Creator, He appointed them Himself. 

The servants perform tasks assigned to them by the Creator. The Creator does speak directly to them, and only them. Wherever in the universe the task is to be completed, the pair are sent and arrive by birth.

## 100% Human
The Creator says the birth of his servants on a planet is absolutely necessary, as they cannot possibly perform their tasks without understanding the world they are living and working in. The servants are 100% human, the miracles they perform are 99.2% the Creator. 

They are “American by birth, and southern by the grace of God” according to TomTom. 

After birth, the two grow up separately and always meet later in life prior to the start of their mission to complete their tasks. They do not always appear to be working together, but are, and are fully-redundant even if geographically separated. 

Typically, Micah is the instigator and Thomas (or “the general”) is the regulator. Neither have ever sat on a cloud, and while Micah plays the piano and Thomas the guitar, neither play a harp. Neither do the creatures they serve. 

Both have served on Earth before, almost every time they become well known and well-documented in history. 

Since humans started keeping history, every mission and they’ve performed on Earth has made them well known. Even if not both of them, that’s because Micah is sometimes not favorably viewed, but his work is necessary. 

Micah says that he is the lowest ranking human being on the planet, and that Thomas is the second-lowest. Because while they work for the Creator, they serve every other human being on the planet. Micah says of the pair, “TomTom is 1,000 years older than me and the Creator’s favorite… They’re closer in age and oh so boring, I can’t imagine their conversations together.” They both have been known to exhibit Earthling characteristics at times. 

The tasks they are given to do have one primary focus: life. Making sure it continues and thrives. Life is always the number one priority of the Creator and His servants. 

Earthling (n): A creature in the Earth neighborhood of the creation, that “makes mountains out of mole hills” and trusts all the wrong things, letting them (eg. the media) do all of their thinking. Ending up, “loving the ones they need to hate, and hating the ones they need to love.” (Quotes of Patricia Williams and Malcom X)

## The Trench Workers 
Micah has described the Servants of the Creator as “trench workers” getting the gifts from the Creator to the people on Earth. He describes the Creator as the bobcat operator who pulls them out in the event of a collapse, but never giving them any time off and putting them right back into the trench. 

## Micah 
Micah was born Kelvin Eugene Williams on March 23, 1977 in Clarksville, TN but central Kentucky, specifically Jessamine County, is home.  He lived in Clarksville, TN as an infant, moved to Lexington with his newly single mother at the age of 1.  After the birth of his sister, Katrina Duvall (on January 6, 1983), the family moved to a house purchased by his mother.  Micah attended Jessamine County High School, but dropped out two months before the graduation of his class--the last to graduate a single high school.  His younger sister attended "East Jessamine County High school" as you can barely see written on her chin (you may need to zoom in), in the [last photo](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/blob/master/assets/karrington_katrina.jpg) of her received by Micah from the CIA.

### Education
GED
Jessamine County High School
Class of 1995
* The Creator says of Micah's 1993 Colts yearbook, "There is only one, if you could call it acceptable ever, acceptable death in the yearbook, You know I hate cars, and he was named after you."  Because in His opinion, everyone else in the yearbook should be alive today.  Micah has had a very difficult time reaching anyone in his small hometown.  Those he has reached, are often impersonators.  

Micah Carr Lawrence was a student at then-JCHS (now West Jessamine) that was killed in a single-vehicle accident.  He had a page dedicated to him in the 1993 yearbook, which from SotC's understanding was used by the CIA to locate all of Micah's classmates after He himself seen it at a friend, Jill Erwin in SW Atlanta, and classmate's house and shared several laughs.  Micah believes they were monitoring or supervising his visit completely undetected (an article on cloaking is planned).

Micah has the _Kick Booty Challenge_ for anyone claiming to be a person in the JCHS 1993 yearbook.

* Micah says that anyone who claiming to be a person shown in the true 1993 JCHS yearbook should be able to correctly answer 5 out of 7 questions:
     - How and where did Micah Carr Lawrence die?
     - What was model & color is Danny K's truck (when you were in high school)?
     - Who provided security at McDonald's (when you were in high school)?
     - Where were you when _the tornado_ hit? 
     - What Home Economics class had the ovens (when you were in high school)?
     - Where were all of the athlete's lockers (or just the "Jocks" when you were in high school)?
     - Were you permitted to smoke cigarettes when you were on school grounds, if so, where?
     - Name all the things wrong with this [Kick Booty ride](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/b4a3017e-08dd-496f-96e7-919eae1b6f05)?
