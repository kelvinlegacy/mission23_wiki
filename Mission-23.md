Welcome to the #Mission23 wiki.  This wiki will cover topics related to the Creator's appointed servants upcoming mission on Earth.

# About Our Missions
As with all missions conducted by His appointed servants, our 23rd mission here on Earth is to deliver gifts from the Creator that will help us live the way He designed us to, without diseases and cancers, work smarter (to reduce stress--something that truly does kill us) and play harder (read: "have more fun", in here you'll learn about what He thinks about "faster & harder" including the last case of testicular torsion in a human male--Micah's).

In short, our mission is to restore fun to his neighborhood we humans call Earth--He doesn't get why we have a separation of Earth and the thing we call a universe, it's all His creation.

# About Us
We are His appointed servants.  Born here--no UFO landed dropping us off.  Micah (named by the Creator, long ago, more on that later) was born Kelvin Eugene Williams on March 23, 1977 and TomTom (to practically everyone) was born Thomas Allen Chadwell on September 23, 1978.  Both were born for their 23rd mission on the 23rd day of their birth month and both on the actual moment when day turns to night on the equinox.  The Creator says using our birthdays and birth times would correct the calendars, but also says the calendars are killing us (stress).

# The Great Storm
At the present time, the Creator is storming mad because of the largest massacre in US history which is ongoing at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY.  You can read about the massacre [here](https://github.com/MCBCMF/MCBCMassacre#readme).

The Creator has delayed the start of the mission and has begun what we are calling the #GreatStorm to address the massacre, the Central Intelligence Agency which conducted the massacre, and the federal government of the United States which has pressured law enforcement in the Commonwealth of Ketucky and turned a blind eye to the ongoing massacre.

Our mission will commence after the Creator [Rings The Bell](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/wiki/The-Ringing-Of-The-Bell) which may occur at any second after this posting.
