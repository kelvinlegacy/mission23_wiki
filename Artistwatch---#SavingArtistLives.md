The CIA hates the messages some music sends. After a guided tour listening to Prince and Vandaveer, any artist or group that Micah selects and plays practically becomes a target.

This list is being made after hearing in a custom-made song (lyrics above) that Ida Corr was murdered. The lyric’s reference a video Micah shared with CIA personnel (in-person and remotely monitoring) called [“Let Me Think About It”](https://youtu.be/7gkhE7t4KCE?si=aE-Q7pw696UqXG16). The Creator confirms, it was one of his songs. Micah said of the video, “Just watch and listen to this guy.”

The CIA has produced a lot of music throughout this entire tragedy that displays their pride in taking lives for money. 

Recently the world learned Tina Turner’s death, she died suddenly (without the public hearing of an illness or fear of death) but the news of her death came exactly one day after “Proud Mary” was played in Micah’s apartment and he used her intro to explain how “We never do anything ‘nice and easy’.”

Regardless of how much Micah let everyone know it wasn’t an official creation by the Creator, Turner’s death was announced. 

## Micah’s Favorites & GoTos
The following artists are listened to by Micah, sometimes to illustrate a point. 

Micah did not know listening to an artist would cause their death, he now restricts his music to purchased music, nothing new. 

For artists that have been murdered the reader should know these have been confirmed by the Creator. Artists notated with “hotel” are being impersonated, see [hotels](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/Hotels).

## The Color Purple
Every actor and actress in [The Color Purple](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0088939/ ) movie are in extreme danger. Especially everyone in the [“God is Trying To Tell You Something” church scene](https://youtu.be/uEv_d6zAYHk?si=bHNF83PjKng8xpuG). Micah has used this scene several times to illustrate the proper way to bust into a church. Micah often adds, “If they had entered Mount Calvary this way, my church family would be talking about it still today, and hoping for a repeat.”

Several others have been mentioned on the @kelvinatlanta Twitter feed with #SavingInnocentLives #SavingArtistsLives 

Micah has a lot to say about “Lizzo” but _enough on that for now._
