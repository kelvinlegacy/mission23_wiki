_**Editor's Note:**  I've been working for the Creator for over six billion Earth years.  I still do not know a damn thing about Him.  Oh, I know Him, far better than everyone else on the planet except for maybe Thomas.  But I still never know what He is gonna do or say about anything.  He's predictable and not at the exact same time.  I believe this article is best if we do a Q&A with the Creator and make it a FAQ._

He is the Creator (always stylized with a upper-case C) , He is often called "The Creator of the Universe," "The Alpha and the Omega," and "The Great I Am."  His two most popular names at today are, "Allah" and "God.” As a religion emerges, especially any monotheistic one, anytime He has been given a new nameHis He has answered calls (prayers) to it, even “Ramen.” 

A common question of, or thought about the Creator is: "Why did you create the Universe?"  The Creator says, "I had to."  He later adds, "It's way more than the total of what you all consider the universe, and that is way more than you can imagine."


One of the first questions of the Creator is, "Is this a sin?"  He says, if you are worried about living right in His eyes, all you need to do is follow the Ten Commandments. 

The Creator says, “Life should be fun. That’s how I intended it to be. So if you need to, add one more commandment: ‘Thou shalt have fun, often.’”

The Creator cares about life, first and foremost.  He detests the loss of life, regardless of the manner of death.  

## The Creator’s Intervention 
The Creator does not normally intervene in human interactions, that is because conscious entities like human beings always escalate when things don’t go as planned. For example, when you’re hammering a nail and the nail isn’t going in, you change your grip and swing the hammer harder. Which mean you can end up with a sore thumb. 

If an unseen force prevents you from doing what you want to do then you woukd escalate in your activity. Therefore, whenever humans need help, He sends His servants in. His servants are just doing what He wants done, and humanity needs done. 

## Homosexuality 
Most base their views on what they think His views are based on what happened in Sodom & Gomorrah. 

Micah has written about this on Medium. See [Micah’s article here](https://medium.com/@micahthemf/what-really-happened-in-sodom-and-gomorrah-a2ecb52f99e8).

To simplify His stance on homosexuality: The Creator does not care with whom you have sex with as long as they are informed and have provided their consent. He does wish that those who routinely engage in sex with the same sex will consider (at least once a year) engaging in sex with the opposite sex for the purposes of conceiving a child. Reproduction is essential to the survival of the human race.

## Life & Death
The Creator’s design never included death. It does occur, but should only be the result of an accident. 

The Creator has several objectives for His servants during mission23 to address death caused by: all diseases, all cancers, and cardiovascular issues. 

### Stress
The Creator says, “Cancer is a new development and directly connected to higher levels of stress.”
The lifestyles of humans today are full of stress which causes all kinds of issues in the body.  

Creator says, "Slow down.  Living does not have to be difficult or stressful.  Do not make it that way for yourself or anyone else."

He says humans also need to slow down in other ways also.  The Creator says to human beings, "You cannot kill yourself under your own power."  If you run as fast as you can into a rock wall, you might get some scrapes and bruises, but you will not kill yourself, by design.  If you put a pair roller skates under you, and hit the same wall, your chances of dying have increased.  

When asked what the Creator thought of cars, He said, "Nope."

## In-Person Visits
The Creator does come to Earth as He can, and does, every place that has conscious life in His Creation. 

The Creator’s visits are generally unannounced even to His servants. 

Recently, He has made numerous visits. The purpose of His visits are CLASSIFIED, details of some may be made public in the future. 

## FAQs of the Creator
From time to time, when time permits, the Servants of the Creator will take questions from the Discussions area (or other online forum as announced) and present them to the Creator and post His responses here.

1. What religion should I be?
     - He doesn’t mind and does not support any particular religion. He does not mind if you go to church. He doesn’t mind if you never go to church. 
     - He knows that people who regularly go to church are overall peaceful beings (doves).
          - He caused “When the Doves Cry” to be written by Prince, the song is only about [the CIA’s massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-CIA-Massacre-of-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church).
