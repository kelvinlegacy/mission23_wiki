_**Editor's Note:**  I've been working for the Creator for over six billion Earth years.  I still do not know a damn thing about Him.  Oh, I know Him, far better than everyone else on the planet except for maybe Thomas.  But I still never know what He is gonna do or say about anything.  He's predictable and not at the exact same time.  I believe this article is best if we do a Q&A with the Creator and make it a FAQ._

He is the Creator (always stylized with a upper-case C) , He is often called "The Creator of the Universe," "The Alpha and the Omega," and "The Great I Am."  His two most popular names at today are, "Allah" and "God."

The Creator cares about life first and foremost.  He detests the loss of life, regardless of the manner of death.  Many religions specify various sins, further many (including clergy) interpret things as sins that he quite simply doesn't mind.  He says, that if you wanted to live right in His eyes, you'd follow the Ten Commandments, and maybe add one more: Have fun.

The Creator says, "Living does not have to be difficult or stressful, do not make it that way."
