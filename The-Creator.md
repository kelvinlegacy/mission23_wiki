_**Editor's Note:**  I've been working for the Creator for over six billion Earth years.  I still do not know a damn thing about Him.  Oh, I know Him, far better than everyone else on the planet except for maybe Thomas.  But I still never know what He is gonna do or say about anything.  He's predictable and not at the exact same time.  I believe this article is best if we do a Q&A with the Creator and make it a FAQ._

He is the Creator (always stylized with a upper-case C) , He is often called "The Creator of the Universe," "The Alpha and the Omega," and "The Great I Am."  His two most popular names at today are, "Allah" and "God.” As a religion emerges, especially any monotheistic one, anytime He has been given a new nameHis He has answered calls (prayers) to it, even “Ramen.” 

A common question of, or thought about the Creator is: "Why did you create the Universe?"  The Creator says, "I had to."  He later adds, "It's way more than the total of what you all consider the universe, and that is way more than you can imagine."

One of the first questions of the Creator is, "Is this a sin?"  He says, if you are worried about living right in His eyes, all you need to do is follow the Ten Commandments. 

The Creator says, “Life should be fun. That’s how I intended it to be. So if you need to, add one more commandment: ‘Thou shalt have fun, often.’”

The Creator cares about life, first and foremost.  He detests the loss of life, regardless of the manner of death.  

Many religions specify various sins, further many (including clergy) interpret things as sins that He quite simply doesn't pay attention to.  In the story of Sodom & Gomorrah, people believe He was upset about homosexual activity. 

The Creator urges his servants to tell the world why He was that upset.  Life was in peril for one woman, at a time when no one died.  The servants had to find her quickly to help Him see how bad her condition was, and help Him ascertain whether or not her condition was one that could affect others.  

That was the last time this planet should have seen a Multiple Sclerosis or any disease for that matter.  The servants were delayed by the town's people who did not understand why they had come looking for only one woman, and no other would suffice.  They did not understand illness or the servants' need to find her quickly, death was only something that happened when humans did something foolish back then (ie. accidents).

In regards to Sodom & Gomorrah, the Creator does not approve or disapprove of any religious text.  He and servants just have first-hand knowledge of it.  We, the servants, say, "The human race is pretty much assuming things on incomplete data, the whole story wasn't passed down."  

His stance on homosexuality is this: "If you prefer to engage in sex with members of the same sex, you must remember that the survival of your species requires reproduction. So, occasionally you should find a member of the opposite sex and reproduce. After that you can resume having sex as you wish.  I do not mind who one (or more) has sex with as long as they are informed and give their consent, only the parents of the individual giving their consent can determine if they are old enough to consent."



On death and illness, He says, "Improper thinking led to death caused by disease, and stress made cancers what they are today. We have a remedy for the improper thinking since that’s made it into male DNA."  

Disease, for example, surfaced in humans just after remedies and potions appeared in human culture. People thought they worked, this caused their brains to stop responding to infectious agents.  All disease, save a couple that are mislabeled as diseases (like Diabetes type I), is infectious in nature.  The Creator says, "Before you think hereditary, think environmental." (The servants will be disseminating  information forthcoming about disease, the immune system, DNA and the subconscious.)

The Creator say, “Cancer as most ‘human beings’ know it is new. Cancer is not caused by anything external, it is the result of mitosis, and it’s just one bad cell copy. That one bad cell CAN be sped up by external forces beyond the body’s built-in ability to correct it.” 

The Creator reminds us of a song: “Slow down you move to fast, gotta make the morning last…”

Remembering can help us all around. The lifestyles humans live are full stress which cause all kinds of issues in the body.  The Creator says, "Slow down.  Living does not have to be difficult or stressful.  Do not make it that way for yourself or anyone else."

We also need to slow down in other ways also.  The Creator says to human beings, "You cannot kill yourself under your own power."  If you run as fast as you can into a rock wall, you might get some scrapes and bruises, but you will not kill yourself, by design.  If you put a pair roller skates under you, and hit the same wall, your chances of dying have increased.  

When asked what the Creator thought of cars, He said, "Nope."

## FAQs of the Creator
From time to time, when time permits, the Servants of the Creator will take questions from the Discussions area (or other online forum as announced) and present them to the Creator and post His responses here.

1. What religion should I be?
     - He doesn’t mind and does not support any particular religion. He does not mind if you go to church. He doesn’t mind if you never go to church. 
     - He knows that people who regularly go to church are overall peaceful beings. Doves. 
     - The Creator does **hear** all prayers.
     -  “‘When the Doves Cry’ by Prince that’s not a couple, don’t think sex, think mom and child IN CHURCH. Don’t think four legged animal, think kills for money, beats his wife to a pulp animal. Oh, and that one verse repeated throughout from Pulp Ficion and stuff… Keep thinking about that verse.  And no, He’s definitely no bitch. Stop cherry picking the Bible.”
