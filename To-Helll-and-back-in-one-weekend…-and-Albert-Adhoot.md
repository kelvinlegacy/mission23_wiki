The best way to give a chronological order of events would be from Micah’s text messages, however, most of his recent exchanges have been deleted. Micah never deletes anything other than automated messages.

# Friday Night

Micah spent Friday night in midtown. He went home, changed clothes and left due to the CIA personnel in his apartment that he cannot have removed. The local police refuse to do anything about “Danny” and company despite numerous attempts and the fact that they know he’s attempted murder several times. [Micah even posted a video of Danny breaking a window to get into his apartment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp3FW9r3O7w), when the police were called they said he could do such.
