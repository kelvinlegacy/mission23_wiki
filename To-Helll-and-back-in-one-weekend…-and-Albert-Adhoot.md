The best way to give a chronological order of events would be from Micah’s text messages, however, most of his recent exchanges have been deleted. Micah never deletes anything other than automated messages.

# Friday Night

Micah spent Friday night in midtown. He went home, changed clothes and left due to the CIA personnel in his apartment that he cannot have removed. The local police refuse to do anything about “Danny” and company despite numerous attempts and the fact that they know he’s attempted murder several times. [Micah even posted a video of Danny breaking a window to get into his apartment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp3FW9r3O7w), when the police were called they said he could do such.

## An Afternoon in Tokyo
The Dimwitted Soul invited Micah to Tokyo Valentino and offered to pay his entry fee. Micah agreed to meet him there a short time later at the Tokyo Valentino location on Cheshire Bridge Road in Atlanta, GA. 

When Matt arrived, Micah joined up with him and entered Tokyo. Matt paid for both of them. 

Micah noticed the crowd at Tokyo Valentino was odd at best. Everyone appeared to be “company” and there was none of the activity expected at Tokyo was occurring. 

Micah had several attempts on his life made and ended up falling asleep in a private room.
