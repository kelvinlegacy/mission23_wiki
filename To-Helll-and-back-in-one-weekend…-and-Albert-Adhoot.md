The best way to give a chronological order of events would be from Micah’s text messages, however, most of his recent exchanges have been deleted. Micah never deletes anything other than automated messages.

# Friday Night

Micah spent Friday night in midtown. He went home, changed clothes and left due to the CIA personnel in his apartment that he cannot have removed. The local police refuse to do anything about “Danny” and company despite numerous attempts and the fact that they know he’s attempted murder several times. [Micah even posted a video of Danny breaking a window to get into his apartment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp3FW9r3O7w), when the police were called they said he could do such.

## An Afternoon in Tokyo
The Dimwitted Soul invited Micah to Tokyo Valentino and offered to pay his entry fee. Micah agreed to meet him there a short time later at the Tokyo Valentino location on Cheshire Bridge Road in Atlanta, GA. 

When Matt arrived, Micah joined up with him and entered Tokyo. Matt paid for both of them. 

Micah noticed the crowd at Tokyo Valentino was odd at best. Everyone appeared to be “company” and there was none of the activity expected at Tokyo was occurring. 

Micah had several attempts on his life made and ended up falling asleep in a private room. 

## The Heist
Micah stepped outside for a cigarette, and found Matt leaving in his car. Micah attempted to get his backpack but Matt insisted that he meet him in front of Tokyo so he could pull over and retrieve it from the tree trunk. 

Micah walked around to the front of Tokyo and Matt was nowhere to be found. 

### Erasure and Lockdown
Following the new SotC protocol, Micah’s backup iPhone was immediately erased using iCloud. 

The Creator instructed Micah to change his iCloud password also, and upon doing so to log out all other devices. Micah did as instructed. 

## You’re not Albert Adhoot!
Micah attempted to contact Matt but couldn’t find his number under recent calls. He became alarmed when he noticed someone had apparently used his phone to contact an old business associate, Albert Adhoot. 

Micah went to his text messages and could not find any messages with the number he’d been communicating with Matt on. He also found a recent text messages with Albert Adhoot. 

Upon opening the message with Albert Adhoot, Micah seen the messages he exchanged with Matt. He checked the number and found the 610 number he had been communicating with was actually the number he had on Albert Adhoot’s contact. 

Micah has not spoken with Adhoot in several years.

## The Assault
## The Morning After
The morning after Micah’s backpack was stolen, his phone reported its location at an apartment complex in Bynam, MS.
