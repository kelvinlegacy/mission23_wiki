# The Ringing of the Bell 

The Creator is going to “ring the bell” very soon. The exact time is not going to be announced, but the order and intensity of the bell ringing (earthquakes) is as follows:

## Orr Chapel Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be located  in Sandy Hook, TN (an unincorporated city near Mount Pleasant) in Maury county. 

This will be a large earthquake for the CIA’s destruction of Orr Chapel ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/XMMdNdpGjU3SMMKQ8)) and the murder of it’s members. 

This quake also recognises Micah’s slain family and his family’s graveyard that was destroyed, both by or at the direction of the CIA. 

## Mount Calvary Baptist Church Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be located at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY (4742 Todds Road). 

This will be the largest quake for the massacre that occurred there. 

## The Micah Quake 
This earthquake’s epicentre will be in Jessamine county, KY. It will signal when Micah (born: Kelvin Eugene Williams on March 23, 1977) has started his mission for the Creator. This will be Micah’s 23rd mission on Earth. 

This minor quake will also be to recognise the lives lost in Jessamine county, mostly Micah’s friends, throughout the larger tragedy. 

## The TomTom Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be in Kanawha county (Hughes Creek), WV. It will signal when TomTom (to practically everyone TomTom, to others Thomas, born: September 23, 1978) has started his mission for the Creator. This also is TomTom’s 23rd mission on Earth. 

This minor quake will also recognise the lives lost in Kanawha county, mostly TomTom’s friends and family, throughout the larger tragedy. 

# Aftermath
The Creator hopes this will be all He has to do to stop the ongoing massacre and end the greater tragedy. 

The tragedy is all a [“Sign of the Times.”](https://youtube.com/watch?v=8EdxM72EZ94&feature=sharea).
, 
And so begins the [“Purple Rain”](https://youtube.com/watch?v=S6Y1gohk5-A&feature=sharea). That means [“It’s raining men.”](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l5aZJBLAu1E&feature=sharea). He has never had to rain down men , although the 23rd mission for both of His servants, they’ve never been identified before. This is just the beginning of the “Great Storm” but it’s the [“Nature of our Kind.”](https://youtube.com/watch?v=lzoABrBtH9A&feature=sharea). 

He does this because life is supposed to be fun. After all, [“Girls just want to have fun.”](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PIb6AZdTr-A&feature=sharea) We WILL get back to fun in this neighborhood called Earth. 

Guys, don’t get hung up on the use of  "woman" or “girl" (it does not always mean female).  

As far as Prince and Vandaveer go, it should serve as a lesson that you never know when the Creator will be using you, in the words of a great friend of mine, Bonnie Bush Ford, "Don't fight the feeling!"  

Prince was Micah's cousin, Prince Rogers Nelson, same as the Sandy Hook Rogers family that Micah was born into.  

Mark, who started Vandaveer, was Micah's (then Kelvin) best friend in middle school (a Jessamine county thing, 6-8th grades) and remained friends through life.
